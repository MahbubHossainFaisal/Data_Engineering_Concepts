    "An **iterator** in Python is an object that can be **iterated upon** (i.e., you can go through all its elements one by one). It must implement two methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `__iter__()` ‚Üí returns the iterator object itself\n",
    "- `__next__()` ‚Üí returns the next value; raises `StopIteration` when no more items\n",
    "\n",
    "You typically use iterators in `for` loops, list comprehensions, etc. Python objects like lists, tuples, dicts, and sets are **iterables**, not necessarily iterators.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can get an iterator from an iterable using `iter()`.\n",

    "1. **Basic Iterator Creation**  \n",
    "   Write a function that creates an iterator from a list and prints all elements using `next()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manual Iteration with `StopIteration`**  \n",
    "   Create an iterator from a list, and manually iterate using a `while` loop that catches `StopIteration`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Custom Iterator - Count Down**  \n",
    "   Create a class `Countdown` that counts down from a given number to zero using the iterator protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Custom Iterator with `for` loop Compatibility**  \n",
    "   Modify your `Countdown` class to work with a `for` loop directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Use `iter()` with a Sentinel**  \n",
    "   Use `iter(func, sentinel)` with a lambda to read random numbers until a specific number is generated.\n",

    "   Create a class `ReversibleList` that supports forward and reverse iteration.\n",

    "   Build a class where you can reset the iterator back to the beginning.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. **Filtering Iterator**  \n",
    "   Create an iterator `FilterIterator` that filters elements based on a condition function.\n",
    "\n",
    "14. **Chained Iterators**  \n",
    "   Write a class `ChainIterator` that takes multiple iterables and chains them together like `itertools.chain()`.\n",

    "\n",
    "20. **Multi-level Peekable Iterator (Like Compiler Lookahead)**  \n",
    "   Build an advanced `LookaheadIterator` that allows multiple levels of peeking (1-step, 2-step, etc.) and supports backtracking.\n",

    "### ‚úÖ **Tips**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Understand**: `iter()` vs `__iter__()`, `next()` vs `__next__()`\n",
    "- **Practice** implementing iterators that behave like standard Python collections.\n",
    "- Know the **use cases** where **generators** may be more suitable than custom iterators.\n",
    "- Read about `itertools` and how your custom iterators relate to those.\n",
    "- Interviewers might ask you to **design streaming or lazy loading systems** ‚Üí iterators are the foundation.\n",
