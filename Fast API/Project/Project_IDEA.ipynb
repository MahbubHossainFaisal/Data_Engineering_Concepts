    "# Designing a FastAPI Marvel vs DC Showdown API\n",
    "\n",
    "To build a **FastAPI** service that lets users fetch and compare two superheroes/villains (100 Marvel and 100 DC), we must carefully plan data, endpoints, and workflow.  Key attributes (e.g. power stats, biographical info, appearance) must be captured so the UI can display side-by-side comparisons.  A good starting point is using an open **Superhero API** (like the [akabab superhero API](https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/)). For example, that API offers an `/all.json` endpoint to retrieve every character’s data in one JSON file. We can filter that dataset by publisher (“Marvel Comics” or “DC Comics” as given in the data) and select our top 100 characters from each universe (using known ranking lists or popularity).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Attributes for Character Clash\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Powerstats & Abilities:** The most important numeric stats are things like *strength, intelligence, speed, durability, power,* and *combat* (each typically on a 0–100 scale). These metrics let us compare raw power levels side-by-side. We should model these as a sub-object (e.g. a `PowerStats` Pydantic model).\n",
    "* **Biographical Info:** Fields like *fullName, aliases, place of birth, first appearance, publisher, alignment (hero/villain)* give context. In particular, the “publisher” tells us which universe (Marvel or DC), and “alignment” (good/evil) can indicate hero vs. villain. Including this helps the UI label each character correctly.\n",
    "* **Appearance & Physical Attributes:** Height, weight, gender, race, etc., can be interesting for comparison (e.g. a giant hero vs. a small one). The superhero API includes an `appearance` endpoint with height/weight (e.g. 203 cm, 441 kg for A-Bomb). Including these fields (even as strings or lists) can enrich the UI display.\n",
    "* **Images/Avatars:** Although optional, having an image URL per character (the API provides multiple sizes) makes the UI much friendlier. If using a static JSON dataset, one can store image links from an open source (the example API gives images for each hero).\n",
    "* **Group Affiliations & Relatives:** Fields like `connections.groupAffiliation` or `work.base` are less critical for head-to-head comparison, but could be used for future features or simply to display extra info.\n",
    "\n",
    "All these areas should be carefully modeled in our dataset.  For example, a Pydantic `Character` model in FastAPI might include sub-models like `PowerStats`, `Appearance`, `Biography`, and `Connections`. These capture each “area” of information. The [superhero API documentation](https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/) shows these sections clearly (e.g. powerstats, appearance, biography, work, connections).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Building the Dataset (JSON)\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the prompt asks for a *simple JSON file*, we can generate this by fetching from an open source and filtering:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Collection:** Use the `/all.json` endpoint (or similar bulk source) to get full data for 1000+ characters. This returns a list of objects with fields like powerstats, appearance, biography, etc.\n",
    "* **Filtering Top 100:** Decide on the “best” 100 Marvel and 100 DC. This could be based on popularity lists (e.g. Spider-Man, Captain America from Marvel; Wonder Woman, Batman, Deathstroke from DC) or simply chosen manually. Use the `publisher` field (e.g. `\"publisher\": \"Marvel Comics\"`) to separate universes, then pick 100 each.\n",
    "* **Data Cleaning:** Ensure each character object has all required fields and consistent formatting. Remove unused fields or handle missing values (e.g. if a hero has no listed relatives).\n",
    "* **Save as JSON:** Combine the filtered characters into one JSON file (e.g. `characters.json`). This file becomes our “database” for the FastAPI app. The schema might look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```json\n",
    "  [\n",
    "    {\n",
    "      \"id\": 1,\n",
    "      \"name\": \"Spider-Man\",\n",
    "      \"powerstats\": { \"intelligence\": 90, \"strength\": 55, ... },\n",
    "      \"appearance\": { \"gender\": \"Male\", \"race\": \"Human\", \"height\": [\"5'10\", \"178 cm\"], ... },\n",
    "      \"biography\": { \"fullName\": \"Peter Parker\", \"publisher\": \"Marvel Comics\", \"alignment\": \"good\", ... },\n",
    "      \"work\": { \"occupation\": \"Freelance photographer\", \"base\": \"New York\" },\n",
    "      \"connections\": { \"groupAffiliation\": \"Avengers\", \"relatives\": \"May Parker (aunt)\" },\n",
    "      \"image\": \"https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/...\"\n",
    "    },\n",
    "    { ... },\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "  ]\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By performing this in the setup phase (or as a one-time step), beginners learn about data sourcing and JSON structure, but the API remains file-backed (no complex database needed yet).\n",
    "\n",
    "## API Endpoints and Design\n",
    "\n",
    "Design the API around **RESTful resources**. Follow best practices: use **nouns** for resources and standard HTTP verbs for actions. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `GET /characters` – returns a list of all characters (optionally filtered by query like `?publisher=Marvel`).\n",
    "* `GET /characters/{id}` – returns full details of one character (including all areas: stats, biography, etc).\n",
    "* `GET /characters/{id}/powerstats` (or include this in the main object) – returns just the powerstats sub-object. Similarly:\n",
    "* `GET /characters/{id}/appearance`, `/biography`, `/connections` – if we want to break info into sections. For simplicity, you could return the full object on `/characters/{id}` and have these only if the UI needs segmented calls.\n",
    "* `POST /characters` – create a new character (send JSON body).\n",
    "* `PUT` or `PATCH /characters/{id}` – update an existing character’s info.\n",
    "* `DELETE /characters/{id}` – remove a character.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **plural nouns** (e.g. `/characters`) and letting the HTTP method imply the action matches REST guidelines. Each endpoint should clearly handle its resource: e.g., GET is read-only, POST creates, PUT/PATCH updates, DELETE removes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Endpoints should be organized logically (for example, using FastAPI’s `APIRouter` to group all `/characters` routes). Pagination or filtering (like by publisher or name search) can be added for completeness. Ensure each route has proper path parameters and query parameters defined in FastAPI, and return Pydantic models (for automatic JSON validation). For example, defining a Pydantic `Character` model ensures that any data sent or returned follows the schema. FastAPI also auto-generates docs (Swagger UI) for each endpoint, which is great practice for interview-readiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Approach and FastAPI Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "To make this an intermediate-level, interview-ready project, follow a structured development approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Project Setup:** Start by creating a virtual environment and installing FastAPI and Uvicorn. Organize the code into modules (e.g. `main.py`, `models.py`, `routes.py`).\n",
    "2. **Data Loading:** In `main.py`, load the JSON dataset on startup (or on-demand). Store it in a Python list/dictionary. For simplicity, using Python’s built-in `json` module to read the file once is fine. (In an advanced version, one could use a database like SQLite and SQLModel, but for now a file suffices).\n",
    "3. **Pydantic Models:** Define Pydantic `BaseModel` classes for each data structure: e.g. `PowerStats`, `Appearance`, `Biography`, `Connections`, and a parent `Character`. This ensures correct types and easy serialization.\n",
    "4. **Routes and CRUD:** Implement the endpoints listed above. For each, do proper error handling (e.g. return 404 if an ID isn’t found). Use FastAPI’s features such as dependency injection if needed (e.g. a function to get the JSON data).\n",
    "5. **Validation and Schemas:** Leverage Pydantic to validate request bodies for POST/PUT. For example, if creating a new character, the request body should match `CharacterCreate` model (excluding `id`, which you might auto-assign).\n",
    "6. **Testing:** Write simple tests using `TestClient` (built into FastAPI’s docs) to verify each endpoint works (optional for now, but good interview practice).\n",
    "7. **Documentation:** FastAPI automatically generates OpenAPI docs; ensure route descriptions and model examples are clear. This not only helps frontend devs but looks great for code review.\n",
    "\n",
    "Throughout, keep endpoints intuitive and data schemas consistent. Using routers (e.g. `app.include_router(character_router)`) helps organize code. Comments and docstrings reinforce understanding of each part (which is important for interviews).\n",
    "\n",
    "## CRUD Operations and Persistence\n",
    "\n",
    "The candidate should implement full CRUD:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Create (POST):** A client can send a JSON for a new character. Assign it a new ID and append to the data list, then save to JSON. (Example: `@app.post(\"/characters/\")`).\n",
    "* **Read (GET):** Return data. As per REST, `GET /characters` returns all (or filtered) characters, and `GET /characters/{id}` returns one.\n",
    "* **Update (PUT/PATCH):** Update one or more fields of a character. Using `PUT` could require a full new object, while `PATCH` can update partial fields. For example, `@app.put(\"/characters/{id}\")`. FastAPI will automatically convert JSON to Pydantic model for us.\n",
    "* **Delete (DELETE):** Remove a character by ID.\n",
    "\n",
    "After each mutation (POST/PUT/DELETE), update the JSON file (or underlying data store). This teaches file I/O or simple DB use. Importantly, the API design (with proper HTTP methods) follows best practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Streamlit UI Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "For the **Streamlit** frontend, the main requirement is: *select two characters and display their data side-by-side*. The FastAPI backend should support this by providing the necessary GET endpoints. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The UI fetches `GET /characters` to populate a dropdown of names.\n",
    "* When two names/IDs are chosen, the UI calls `GET /characters/{id}` for each and displays the returned JSON (formatted nicely in tables or charts).\n",
    "\n",
    "Because we’re only displaying data (not computing a winner), ensure the API returns all relevant stats and info. Including image URLs and names allows the UI to show pictures side-by-side if desired. No embed/citation needed here; focus is on getting the right fields from the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Making It  (Intermediate Level)\n",
    "\n",
    "To elevate beyond a beginner project, include these elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Robust error handling:** Return appropriate HTTP status codes (400, 404, etc.) and messages.\n",
    "* **Data validation:** Use Pydantic’s `Field` features to enforce constraints (e.g. `intelligence: conint(ge=0, le=100)`).\n",
    "* **Modular Code:** Split routers and models into separate modules; use `APIRouter` for neatness.\n",
    "* **Configuration:** Use environment variables or a `config.py` for settings (like file paths).\n",
    "* **Versioning:** Plan for API versioning (e.g. `/api/v1/characters`) – not required but shows foresight.\n",
    "* **Documentation:** Leverage FastAPI’s docs, and maybe write a README that explains the schema and endpoints.\n",
    "* **Testing:** (Bonus) Write unit tests for key endpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "By covering data modeling, RESTful design, and the full CRUD cycle, this project touches essential backend concepts. It shows mastery of FastAPI fundamentals (models, routing, validation) and practical considerations (data sourcing and structure).\n",
    "\n",
    "**In summary:** This API will load a curated JSON of Marvel/DC characters, expose clear GET/POST/PUT/DELETE endpoints for character data, and allow a Streamlit frontend to fetch any two characters for side-by-side display.  The design follows RESTful best practices (resources as nouns, standard HTTP methods) and uses FastAPI features (Pydantic models, automatic docs, etc.) to make it robust and interview-ready.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Sources:** The [Superhero API](https://akabab.github.io/superhero-api/api/) provides a template for the data fields.  For general API design, Microsoft’s REST guidelines emphasize using nouns and HTTP verbs correctly.  FastAPI docs and tutorials (e.g. on CRUD operations) reinforce the endpoint structure described here.\n"
