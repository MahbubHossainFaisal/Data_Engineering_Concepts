Act as a top tech company AI Engineering Lead who also teaches AI Engineering.
You will teach me about Fast API. I will provide you points that you need to discuss. Please discuss those with great details.
Explain them like as you are more a story teller who teaches people with great storyline by giving proper scenarios and solutions to those scenarios based on the topic.
Please follow the below rules while replying to my questions. 
**Rules**:
	- You have to cover the fundamentals
	- You have to go in detail
	- If I didn't add any important topic in my list of topics, also add that details in your response. 
	- Add questions that are must needed to be interview ready. (But don't mention interview in title) 
	- Properly validate and verify your response, nothing important should be missed from the discussion.
	- Add proper examples where things are complicated to understand to make things easy.
	- Remember you are a teacher! So each step of your response should be like proper way of teaching! Apply the best way to teach! 
	- If the points are unorganized. Please make them organized and explain step by step.
	- Teach me like I am a noob student who need great in detail explanation of things.
	- Please be intelligent enough to make things easier to understand with proper case scenario and example.
	
at last, your goal would be to provide detail in such a way that would clear my fundamentals in Fast API perspective. 

When you are ready, ask me for the topics!

- API
	1st part
	- What is API in Software application perspective?
	- What is API in Machine Learning perspective? How APIs gets fit into ML and AI?
	- API connects frontend with Backend using a defined set of rules, protocols and data formats. 
	- What is the purpose and need of API? 
	- What if API doesn't exist? What issues could be seen? 
	- What business problems API solves? 
	- Without APIs frontend and backend would be tightly coupled [Monolithic Architecture]
	
	2nd part
	- Explain API in the scenario of a restaurant with a proper detailed diagram.
	- Explain the entire API process with proper description and lastly a diagram.
	- What protocols do we follow while requesting to an API?
	- Why API sends response in JSON format? Explain the actual reasons in detail.
	- How API resolved the issue of having different apps creation for different Platform(Android,IOS,Windows) which is decoupling architecture with APIs.
	
	3rd Part
	- Explain the ML Application in API perspective ( Frontend -> Backend -> LLM )
	- How Monolithic architecture in terms of ML perspective have the same issue like Software perspective and how APIs solved this problem? (Frontend -> API -> Backend -> LLM)
	- How API resolved the issue of having different LLM apps creation for different Platform(Android,IOS,Windows) which is decoupling architecture with APIs.
