    "\n",
    "You realize: not all data deserves the same **level of durability or recovery cost**.\n",

    "### üß≠ Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "Permanent tables are the **default** in Snowflake.\n",
    "They‚Äôre meant for your **gold layer**, **fact tables**, **dimension tables**, and **any dataset that must survive restarts, mistakes, or disasters.**\n",
    "\n",
    "When you create a table without specifying `TRANSIENT` or `TEMPORARY`, Snowflake automatically makes it **PERMANENT**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SALES_FACT (\n",
    "  ORDER_ID INT,\n",
    "  CUSTOMER_ID INT,\n",

    "* **Time Travel**: By default, 1 day (can be increased up to 90 days depending on your account edition).\n",
    "  You can query older versions or recover dropped tables during this window.\n",
    "* **Fail-safe**: After Time Travel ends, Snowflake keeps a **7-day Fail-safe** period (for emergencies, Snowflake-managed).\n",
    "  You can‚Äôt query it; only Snowflake support can recover data if necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the total data life cycle looks like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Active ‚Üí (Time Travel window, user can recover) ‚Üí (Fail-safe window, Snowflake support only) ‚Üí Permanent deletion\n",

    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Cons\n",
    "\n",
    "‚ùå More expensive ‚Äî because of Time Travel + Fail-safe storage.\n",
    "‚ùå Historical data retention consumes storage.\n",

    "Great question ‚Äî this shows deeper understanding.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you **drop a permanent table**, Snowflake doesn‚Äôt send it straight to Fail-safe.\n",
    "Instead, it first goes into the **Time Travel retention period** ‚Äî where *you* can still recover it using `UNDROP TABLE`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Only after this Time Travel window expires (e.g., 1 day, 7 days, etc.) does Snowflake move that dropped table‚Äôs data into **Fail-safe** for an additional 7 days.\n",

    "### üß≠ Purpose\n",
    "\n",
    "If your **entire environment** (like staging or dev) doesn‚Äôt require Fail-safe,\n",
