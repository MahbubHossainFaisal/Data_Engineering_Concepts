    "  1. **Warn them** when 80% is gone.\n",
    "  2. **Stop them from spending more** after 100%.\n",
    "  3. Or **suspend them immediately** at 100% (no more cash, even mid-purchase).\n",
    "\n",
    "That‚Äôs exactly what Resource Monitors do for warehouses.\n",

    "  * Risk: user queries may fail.\n",
    "  * Use this for strict budgets.\n",
