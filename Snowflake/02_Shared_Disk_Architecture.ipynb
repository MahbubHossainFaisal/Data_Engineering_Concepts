    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🏙️ City 1: Shared Disk — \"One Giant Library with Many Visitors\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is **one big central library** where all books (data) are stored.\n",
    "* Many reading rooms (computes) exist, but **they all connect to the same library**.\n",
    "* Everyone has to **wait their turn** to access the same shelves (I/O bottleneck).\n",
    "* If one reader updates a book, others may **read stale data** (consistency problems).\n",
    "* Adding more reading rooms doesn’t help much—**everyone still shares the same shelves**.\n",

    "📌 **Problem**: It’s hard to scale. The more people that join, the more **congestion and coordination problems** arise.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 🏙️ City 2: Shared Nothing — \"Neighborhood Libraries with Their Own Books\"\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every neighborhood has its **own local library** and staff.\n",
    "* People **don’t interfere** with each other since all data and staff are separate.\n",
    "* If one library gets crowded, you build another one—with its own books.\n",
    "\n",
    "BUT:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every library keeps **a separate copy of the books**—this causes duplication.\n",

    "* Want to run a big city-wide reading event? Now you must **shuffle books** between libraries (network overhead).\n",
    "* Also, if you just want to scale compute power, **you must also scale storage**, even if you don’t need more.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Stores all data in a single, central, well-organized, and secure place.\n",
    "* Everyone in the city reads from **one master copy** — no duplicates, no confusion.\n",

    "  * What actions are happening inside (Transaction Management & Metadata Tracking)\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 🪑 3. **Reading Rooms (Virtual Warehouses / Compute Layer)**\n",
    "\n",
    "* These are **independent reading rooms** inside the library.\n",
    "* You can open **multiple rooms at once**, each with its own lighting, staff, and silence.\n",

    "Snowflake solves all the major problems that traditional systems had — while **staying in the central library analogy**:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "#### ❌ Problem 1: “What if many people want the same book at once?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional systems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Everyone tries to grab the same book — leading to delays, conflicts, or multiple copies being created.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Snowflake:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Readers don’t directly touch the book.\n",
    "* Instead, **virtual reading assistants** hand them **instant, consistent views** of the same book.\n",
    "* Everyone can read the **same book at once**, without waiting or duplicating it.\n",

    "✅ **Result:** No contention, no duplication — full parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ Problem 2: “What if some readers are noisy or slow?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional systems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* All readers share the same space — slow readers block others.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Snowflake:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each group gets **its own private reading room** (Virtual Warehouse).\n",
    "* Reading rooms are isolated. One group reading all night doesn’t bother the other doing a quick scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Result:** Full workload isolation. Analysts, data scientists, and execs can work at once — **without slowing each other down**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ Problem 3: “What if we want to scale the library quickly?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional systems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Scaling meant physically adding more shelves or staff — time-consuming.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Snowflake:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Instantly open more reading rooms when needed.\n",
    "* The **smart manager** ensures rooms are auto-scaled based on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Result:** Elastic compute. Pay for what you use, scale when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ❌ Problem 4: “How do we keep track of everything happening inside?”\n",
    "\n",
    "**Traditional systems:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You need extra tools to monitor what’s happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Snowflake:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **smart manager** sees:\n",
    "\n",

    "### 2. **What is Shared Disk Architecture?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "In this model, **all compute nodes share a common storage (disk)**. Each node has its own memory and CPU but accesses a single shared storage system.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **What problem does Shared Disk solve?**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scalability**: Not easy to scale horizontally because all nodes compete for the same disk.\n",
    "* **Performance bottlenecks**: Communication between nodes and the shared disk becomes a **bottleneck**.\n",
