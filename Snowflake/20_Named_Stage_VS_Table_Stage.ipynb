    "# 📘 Learning Snowflake Named Stages\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. **Understanding What a Stage Is**\n",
    "\n",
    "Before diving into *Named Stage*, let’s clarify the foundation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **stage** in Snowflake is simply a **temporary parking lot for files** before they enter a table.\n",
    "  Think of it as an **airport terminal** where your passengers (data files) wait before boarding their planes (tables).\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake provides 3 main types of stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Table stage** – every table has its own mini stage (hidden behind the scenes).\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Files go here if they are only relevant to that table.\n",
    "2. **User stage** – each user has one.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Your personal scratchpad.\n",
    "3. **Named stage** – a **custom stage** you explicitly create.\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Shared “warehouse” where files can be reused for multiple tables/users.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **When Do You Need a Named Stage?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s build a **story**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are working at a company called **ShopNow**, which has multiple departments:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sales Team** loads daily transaction files.\n",
    "* **Marketing Team** loads customer engagement files.\n",
    "* **Finance Team** loads revenue files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, you could just drop each file into a **table stage** — but here’s the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each table stage is tied to *one table only*.\n",
    "* If both Sales and Finance want to use the same file (say, `transactions_2025_08_24.csv`), you’d need to duplicate the file into both table stages.\n",
    "  ❌ Waste of storage, ❌ messy management.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Solution: Put the file in a **Named Stage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Everyone can access the same file.\n",
    "* You only manage one copy.\n",
    "* You can even apply access control: Sales team can read only sales files, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, **Named Stage = Shared Warehouse for data files**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Creating a Named Stage (Internal)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of it as creating a labeled warehouse shelf in Snowflake’s storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Syntax:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE STAGE my_stage;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a **named stage** in Snowflake’s internal storage.\n",
    "(You can also create external ones pointing to S3, Azure Blob, or GCP, but we’re focusing internal here).\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 You can also attach a **file format** for easier loading:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE STAGE my_stage\n",
    "  FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY='\"' SKIP_HEADER=1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, every time you load a file from `my_stage`, Snowflake knows how to interpret it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. **Uploading Files to a Named Stage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Okay, now our Sales team wants to upload `sales_august.csv` into `my_stage`.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "PUT file://C:\\data\\sales_august.csv @my_stage;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This pushes a local file into Snowflake internal stage.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `file://` → your local path\n",
    "* `@my_stage` → the named stage destination\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. **Check if Files Are in the Stage**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like checking if your package reached the warehouse.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "LIST @my_stage;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows all files sitting in that stage.\n",
    "Output includes file names, size, and timestamp.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 6. **Loading Files from Named Stage into a Table**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we want to move passengers (files) from the **stage (terminal)** into the **table (plane)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "COPY INTO sales_table\n",
    "FROM @my_stage/sales_august.csv\n",
    "FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = 'CSV' FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY='\"' SKIP_HEADER=1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `COPY INTO` → the load command\n",
    "* `@my_stage/sales_august.csv` → specific file\n",
    "* `sales_table` → target table\n",
    "* `FILE_FORMAT` → how to parse file\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 7. **What If I Want Only Specific Columns?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose the file has 6 columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "`id, date, product, quantity, price, region`\n",
    "\n",
    "But your **sales\\_table** only needs `id, product, price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can **map specific columns**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "COPY INTO sales_table (id, product, price)\n",
    "FROM (\n",
    "  SELECT $1, $3, $5\n",
    "  FROM @my_stage/sales_august.csv (FILE_FORMAT => 'my_csv_format')\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `$1` = first column in the file\n",
    "* `$3` = third column\n",
    "* `$5` = fifth column\n",
    "\n",
    "This way, you can skip unnecessary columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 8. **Loading Same Data into Multiple Tables**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a real case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Sales team** needs `id, product, price`.\n",
    "* **Finance team** needs `id, quantity, price`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of uploading two files:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Sales load\n",
    "COPY INTO sales_table (id, product, price)\n",
    "FROM (\n",
    "  SELECT $1, $3, $5\n",
    "  FROM @my_stage/sales_august.csv (FILE_FORMAT => 'my_csv_format')\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Finance load\n",
    "COPY INTO finance_table (id, quantity, price)\n",
    "FROM (\n",
    "  SELECT $1, $4, $5\n",
    "  FROM @my_stage/sales_august.csv (FILE_FORMAT => 'my_csv_format')\n",
    ");\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both teams reuse the **same staged file**, just selecting different slices.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 9. **Where Named Stage Commands Differ from Table Stage Commands**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an excellent question.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both **Named Stages** and **Table Stages** use the same core commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PUT`\n",
    "* `LIST`\n",
    "* `COPY INTO`\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 **Key difference:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Table Stage** is tied to a single table → you don’t specify its name, you just do:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  COPY INTO my_table\n",
    "  FROM @%my_table;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "  (`@%tablename` is shorthand for its table stage)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Named Stage** is independent → you explicitly refer to its name:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  COPY INTO my_table\n",
    "  FROM @my_stage;\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, difference = **referencing method** + **reusability scope**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 10. **Extra Important Details You Shouldn’t Miss**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can use **versioning**: Snowflake automatically appends numbers if you upload same file name multiple times.\n",
    "* You can use `REMOVE @stage` to delete staged files.\n",
    "* Internal named stages **do cost storage** (since files are stored inside Snowflake).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. **Must-Answer Questions to Test Your Fundamentals**\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the questions you must be able to answer confidently:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. What’s the difference between a Named Stage and a Table Stage?\n",
    "2. In which scenario would you prefer a Named Stage?\n",
    "3. How do you create a Named Stage with a file format?\n",
    "4. How do you load a file into Snowflake using `COPY INTO`?\n",
    "5. How do you verify which files exist in a stage?\n",
    "6. How do you load only specific columns from a file into a table?\n",
    "7. How do you load the same staged file into multiple tables?\n",
    "8. What happens if you upload two files with the same name into a stage?\n",
    "9. How do you clean up staged files once processed?\n",
    "10. What are the differences between internal and external stages?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ With this, you now have a **solid understanding of Named Stages** — when to use them, how to create, load, validate, and reuse them, plus the **key differences** from Table Stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Would you like me to **also expand this lesson into External Named Stages (S3, Azure, GCP)** with real-world scenarios (like multi-cloud pipelines), or do you want to first master **internal named stages only** before moving outward?\n"

    "\n",
    "* **Table Stage (`@%table`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Automatically created with every table.\n",
    "  * Used when files belong **only to that table**.\n",
    "  * Scope = *one table*.\n",
    "  * Example: `COPY INTO my_table FROM @%my_table;`\n",

    "  * Scope = *database object with broader usage*.\n",
    "  * Example: `COPY INTO my_table FROM @my_stage;`\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Rule of Thumb: **Use table stage if file is for one table only, named stage if you want to reuse the file across tables or teams.**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## **2. In which scenario would you prefer a Named Stage?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A `transactions.csv` file contains columns useful for **Sales**, **Finance**, and **Marketing**.\n",
    "* If you use table stages, you’ll have to upload 3 copies into 3 different table stages.\n",
    "* With a **named stage**, you upload once → everyone uses it.\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Named stage is preferred when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Multiple tables need the same file**.\n",
    "* **Multiple users need to share data**.\n",
