    "Your team at **Retail-X** has raw CSV/JSON files landing in an S3 bucket every hour.

    "**Q: “If we keep S3 and Snowflake in the same region, we won’t incur extra cost.”**\n",
    "**A:** Mostly right—but nuanced. Same-region avoids AWS **data transfer out** fees you’d pay for cross-region reads. You still pay S3 **request** charges and Snowflake compute for loading. Always check the current S3 pricing page. ([Amazon Web Services, Inc.][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: “S3 policies—what do we need?”**\n",
    "**A:** On the IAM **role** that Snowflake assumes: `s3:ListBucket` (limited to your prefixes) and `s3:GetObject` (+ `s3:PutObject` if unloading). If using KMS: allow `kms:Decrypt/Encrypt/GenerateDataKey`. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: “How to create an IAM policy?”**\n",
    "**A:** Use the inline JSON shown in §3.2 (tailor bucket names/prefixes). Attach it to the **role** you created for Snowflake. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: “IAM Role—step by step?”**\n",
    "**A:** Create role → set **trust policy** to the **Snowflake IAM User ARN** + require `sts:ExternalId` from `DESC INTEGRATION` → attach the S3 permissions inline policy. (Trust is on the **role**, not on S3 itself—S3 doesn’t have “trust relationships.”)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: “Create Snowflake Integration object—full process?”**\n",
    "**A:** `CREATE STORAGE INTEGRATION` with your allowed locations → `DESC INTEGRATION` to get **IAM user ARN** + **External ID** → build AWS **role + trust policy** → `ALTER STORAGE INTEGRATION ... SET STORAGE_AWS_ROLE_ARN='arn:aws:iam::...:role/...'`. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: “Can I add more S3 paths to one integration?”**\n",
    "**A:** Yes. Use `ALTER STORAGE INTEGRATION ... SET STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS = (...)` to add more URIs. Also update the IAM policy `Resource` ARNs accordingly. ([Snowflake Documentation][5])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Q: “How do I get the Snowflake ARN and add it to the trust relationship? External ID too?”**\n",
    "**A:** `DESC INTEGRATION <name>` returns `STORAGE_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN` and `STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID`. Put the ARN under `Principal.AWS` and add a `Condition` requiring `sts:ExternalId` to equal that value. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",

    "## **4) How do `STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS` and your IAM `Resource` ARNs work together to enforce least privilege?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS` → Snowflake-side filter: limits what URIs you can use in a stage.\n",
    "* IAM `Resource` ARNs → AWS-side filter: limits what Snowflake’s role can actually access.\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Both must allow access. If either side denies, access fails → “defense in depth.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5) Your files are SSE-KMS. What two places must mention the KMS key to succeed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. In the **Snowflake stage definition**, add:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ENCRYPTION = ( TYPE='AWS_SSE_KMS' KMS_KEY_ID='<kms-key-arn>' )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "2. In AWS IAM and **KMS key policy**: grant the Snowflake IAM role permissions (`kms:Decrypt`, `kms:Encrypt`, `kms:GenerateDataKey`).\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Both are needed. If you forget the key policy, you’ll see `AccessDeniedException` even if IAM role has permissions.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **6) Give a `COPY INTO` command that first validates and then loads, capturing bad rows (what two clauses do you change?).**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 1 – validate only:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  COPY INTO retailx_orders\n",
    "  FROM @retailx_ext_stage\n",
    "  FILES=('2025/08/28/orders_*.csv.gz')\n",
    "  VALIDATION_MODE = 'RETURN_ERRORS';\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Step 2 – real load with bad rows captured:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  COPY INTO retailx_orders\n",
    "  FROM @retailx_ext_stage\n",
    "  FILES=('2025/08/28/orders_*.csv.gz')\n",
    "  ON_ERROR = 'CONTINUE';\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Change **`VALIDATION_MODE`** for dry run, and then use **`ON_ERROR`** when doing the actual load.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **7) Where do you find the Snowflake IAM User ARN and External ID you must put in AWS? Which command shows them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "Run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DESC INTEGRATION retailx_s3_int;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Look for:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `STORAGE_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN`\n",
    "* `STORAGE_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID`\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 These values must be plugged into the AWS IAM Role trust policy.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **8) What happens (cost-wise and latency-wise) if your S3 bucket is in a different region than Snowflake? Where would you verify current pricing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Cost:** You pay AWS **cross-region data transfer charges** when Snowflake reads from the bucket.\n",
    "* **Latency:** Data travels across regions → slower load times.\n",
    "* **Where to check:** AWS **S3 Pricing** page (specifically “Data Transfer” section).\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Always align Snowflake region with S3 bucket region if possible.\n",
