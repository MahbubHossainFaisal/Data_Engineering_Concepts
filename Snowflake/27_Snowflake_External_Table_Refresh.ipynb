    "let’s do a **practical, copy-pasteable, step-by-step guide** for both approaches Snowflake supports for *automatic* external-table refresh on AWS S3:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Option A — SQS (simple and common)**: Snowflake provides an SQS queue ARN for your external table; you wire your S3 bucket event notifications to that queue. Snowflake listens to that queue and automatically refreshes the external table metadata. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Option B — SNS (broadcaster / existing-notifications)**: Use SNS as a broadcaster so multiple subscribers (Lambda, other SQS, Snowflake) can get the same S3 events. You’ll create an SNS topic, add the Snowflake-generated policy to the topic access policy (Snowflake helps you generate it), then create the external table pointing to that SNS topic (or subscribe Snowflake’s SQS queue to it). ([Snowflake Documentation][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "Below I walk you through both options (AWS console steps + Snowflake SQL), verification, and common gotchas.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Quick prerequisites & rules of thumb\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your Snowflake account must be on **AWS** to use these features. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "* You must have **admin access** to the target AWS account (create SNS/SQS, change bucket notifications, edit SNS policy). ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "* Best practice: create the S3 event filter (prefix/suffix) narrow enough to avoid noise/cost. AWS forbids overlapping queue configs for the same prefix. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option A — Use Snowflake’s SQS queue (recommended when you don’t already have SNS)\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the easiest: Snowflake provides the SQS queue ARN, you configure the S3 bucket to push events to that SQS queue, and Snowflake will auto-refresh your external table metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High level flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create stage & external table in Snowflake (AUTO\\_REFRESH is `TRUE` by default).\n",
    "2. Run `SHOW EXTERNAL TABLES;` and copy the `notification_channel` SQS ARN.\n",
    "3. In AWS S3 console, create an event notification that sends `ObjectCreated` (and `ObjectRemoved`) events to that SQS ARN.\n",
    "4. Run one `ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE ... REFRESH;` to seed metadata — after that notifications trigger automatic refreshes. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step (with examples)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create stage (example):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "USE SCHEMA mydb.public;\n",
    "\n",
    "CREATE STAGE mystage\n",
    "  URL = 's3://mybucket/path'\n",
    "  STORAGE_INTEGRATION = my_storage_int;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create external table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE ext_table\n",
    "  WITH LOCATION = @mystage/somepath/\n",
    "  FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = PARQUET);\n",
    "-- AUTO_REFRESH = TRUE is default (unless PARTITION_TYPE=USER_SPECIFIED)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(If you have partitioning expressions, define them here; note manual partitions disable auto refresh.)\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Get the SQS queue ARN that Snowflake wants you to wire S3 to:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SHOW EXTERNAL TABLES;\n",
    "-- look at the notification_channel column — copy that ARN (it’s an SQS ARN)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`notification_channel` = the ARN of Snowflake’s SQS queue for your external-table region/account. ([Snowflake Documentation][3])\n",
    "\n",
    "4. In AWS (S3 bucket):\n",
    "\n",
    "* Open the **S3 console → Buckets → your-bucket → Properties → Event notifications**.\n",
    "* **Create event notification**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Name: `AutoRefresh-Snowflake` (or anything)\n",
    "  * Events: **ObjectCreated (All)** and **ObjectRemoved** (or choose specific ones)\n",
    "  * Destination: **SQS queue**\n",
    "  * SQS queue ARN: **paste the notification\\_channel ARN** you copied from `SHOW EXTERNAL TABLES`\n",
    "  * Optionally add prefix/suffix filters (e.g., `path/2025/09/`) to narrow events.\n",
    "    Save. (AWS doc on S3 event notifications). ([AWS Documentation][4])\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Manually seed metadata once:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE ext_table REFRESH;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After this one manual refresh the S3 → SQS events will automatically trigger future refreshes. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Verify**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `SHOW EXTERNAL TABLES;` — `last_refreshed_on` should update after an S3 PUT/DELETE. ([Snowflake Documentation][3])\n",
    "* Check SQS queue in AWS Console (Messages in queue) — should see S3 event messages if an object was created.\n",
    "* If table is not updating, run `ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;` and re-query (to avoid result cache confusion).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Common gotchas**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Snowflake designates *no more than one* Snowflake SQS queue per AWS region; the same queue can service multiple buckets/prefixes. Don’t create conflicting S3 notifications (AWS forbids overlapping queue configs). ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "* If your external table uses **user-specified partitions** (`PARTITION_TYPE = USER_SPECIFIED`), `AUTO_REFRESH = TRUE` is **not supported** — you must manage partitions manually. (See CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE docs.) ([Snowflake Documentation][5])\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# Option B — Use SNS as a broadcaster (if you already use SNS or share notifications)\n",
    "\n",
    "Use this when S3 already publishes to an SNS topic or when multiple subscribers need the same events.\n",
    "\n",
    "**High level flow**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create SNS topic (or use existing topic) and note ARN.\n",
    "2. Use Snowflake to generate the little IAM policy snippet that *lets Snowflake’s SQS queue subscribe to your SNS topic* (call `SYSTEM$GET_AWS_SNS_IAM_POLICY`). ([Snowflake Documentation][6])\n",
    "3. Merge that policy into the SNS topic access policy in the AWS console (so Snowflake’s SQS can subscribe).\n",
    "4. Create external table with `AWS_SNS_TOPIC = '<your_sns_arn>'` (this causes Snowflake to subscribe its SQS queue to your SNS topic).\n",
    "5. Run `ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE ... REFRESH;` once to seed metadata. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Step-by-step (with examples)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Create SNS topic** (AWS Console → SNS → Topics → Create topic) — use **Standard** topic (not FIFO). Note the Topic ARN (e.g. `arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111122223333:mytopic`). (AWS docs). ([AWS Documentation][4])\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **(Optional) Subscribe other endpoints** you need (other SQS/Lambda/email) to the topic.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Get the Snowflake IAM policy snippet** that grants Snowflake permission to subscribe a Snowflake-managed SQS queue to your topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- run this in Snowflake (replace with your SNS ARN)\n",
    "SELECT SYSTEM$GET_AWS_SNS_IAM_POLICY('arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111122223333:mytopic');\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The function returns a JSON policy piece you must add to the SNS topic policy. (Snowflake docs explain this function.) ([Snowflake Documentation][6])\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Edit the SNS topic Access policy (AWS)** — open the topic → Edit → *Access policy* → merge the JSON returned by Snowflake into the topic policy and save. This step allows the Snowflake SQS queue (created by Snowflake when you create the external table) to subscribe to the SNS topic. ([Snowflake Documentation][7])\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Create your external table with the SNS ARN** — this tells Snowflake to subscribe its SQS queue to your SNS topic:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE ext_table\n",
    "  WITH LOCATION = @mystage/path1/\n",
    "  FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = JSON)\n",
    "  AWS_SNS_TOPIC = 'arn:aws:sns:us-east-1:111122223333:mytopic';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run this, Snowflake will wire its SQS queue to the SNS topic (subscription) and handle receiving messages. ([Snowflake Documentation][5])\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Manually refresh once**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE ext_table REFRESH;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After this, S3→SNS→(Snowflake SQS) will trigger automatic metadata refreshes for this external table. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative SNS path if you need Snowflake → SNS outbound notifications (advanced)**\n",
    "Snowflake also supports **CREATE NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION** for outbound notifications to an SNS topic (this is a different feature used to let Snowflake publish events to SNS). That requires you to create an IAM role, run `CREATE NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION ... NOTIFICATION_PROVIDER = AWS_SNS`, then run `DESC NOTIFICATION INTEGRATION` to get `SF_AWS_IAM_USER_ARN` and `SF_AWS_EXTERNAL_ID` and update the IAM role trust policy accordingly. (This is used when Snowflake must assume an IAM role to send messages *outbound* to SNS.) See Snowflake docs for the full flow. ([Snowflake Documentation][2])\n",
