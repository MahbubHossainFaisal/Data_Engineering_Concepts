    "# 2. **The LOAD\\_HISTORY View**\n",
    "\n",
    "This lives in the **`INFORMATION_SCHEMA`** and gives a lightweight summary of past COPY INTO operations.\n",
    "Key things about it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* It **retains only 14 days** of history.\n",
    "* It shows **one row per file** loaded into a table.\n",
    "* **Limit:** Only up to **10,000 rows** can be returned at once.\n",
    "* Perfect for **quick checks** when troubleshooting.\n",
    "\n",

    "* **LAST\\_LOAD\\_TIME** → When the file was loaded.\n",

    "* **STATUS** → Whether the load succeeded or failed.\n",
    "* **FIRST\\_ERROR\\_MESSAGE / FIRST\\_ERROR\\_LINE** → If something broke, you’ll see the first error here.\n",
    "* **TABLE\\_NAME & SCHEMA\\_NAME** → To confirm the target location.\n",

    "# 3. **The COPY\\_HISTORY View**\n",

    "Now here’s where things get **deeper**.\n",
    "`COPY_HISTORY` is accessed using the **table function** `COPY_HISTORY(<table_name>, <start_time>, <end_time>)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This view is **richer than LOAD\\_HISTORY** because it doesn’t just show rows per file—it also shows metadata about the COPY command execution itself.\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COPY_HISTORY(\n",

    "This is where you get that extra context:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **FILE\\_NAME** → Same as load history, file-level tracking.\n",
    "* **LAST\\_LOAD\\_TIME** → Time of file load.\n",
    "* **ROW\\_COUNT / ERROR\\_COUNT** → Rows successfully ingested vs. rows errored.\n",
    "* **STATUS** → Success, error, or partially loaded.\n",
    "* **FIRST\\_ERROR\\_MESSAGE / LINE / CHARACTER\\_POS** → Pinpoint the first failure.\n",
    "* **TABLE\\_NAME** → Where the file landed.\n",
    "* **PIPE\\_NAME** → If you’re using Snowpipe, this tells you which pipe ingested it.\n",
    "* **COPY\\_STATEMENT** → The actual COPY INTO statement that ran.\n",
    "* **PARSE\\_TIMESTAMP** → When the file was parsed.\n",
    "* **SCAN\\_CYCLE / VALIDATION\\_MODE** → More advanced details, especially for debugging validation runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "So think of COPY\\_HISTORY as your **black box recorder in an airplane**: it not only tells you that the plane flew but also how it flew, which pilot (pipe) flew it, and what the exact flight plan (COPY statement) was.\n",

    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Check LOAD\\_HISTORY**:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT FILE_NAME, STATUS, LAST_LOAD_TIME\n",
    "   FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.LOAD_HISTORY\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If the file is not listed → it was **never loaded** (maybe missed in staging or COPY command).\n",
    "   * If it’s listed but status = `LOAD_FAILED` → the file tried but failed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Check COPY\\_HISTORY** for deeper info:\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT FILE_NAME, ROW_COUNT, ERROR_COUNT, FIRST_ERROR_MESSAGE\n",
    "   FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COPY_HISTORY(\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If error count > 0 → File was partially loaded.\n",
    "   * If COPY statement looks wrong → maybe file format mismatch.\n",

    "3. **Load Failure Alert**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Monitor COPY\\_HISTORY for `STATUS = LOAD_FAILED`.\n",
    "   * Alert ops immediately with the error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Snowpipe Monitoring**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Since COPY\\_HISTORY also tracks Snowpipe, you can alert if a pipe hasn’t loaded any file in X hours.\n",
