    "# Snowflake Stages — the practical, story-driven deep dive (with commands you’ll actually use)\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you just joined a fintech where raw files land in three places: a vendor’s S3 bucket, your analysts’ laptops, and an internal app that exports JSON. Your job is to make all three reliable and repeatable. In Snowflake, **stages** are your “loading docks” for files; **file formats** are the “instructions” for how to read/write those files. Put them together and your pipelines become boring—in the best way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Below is a step-by-step guide that covers the fundamentals, goes deep where it matters, fixes common misconceptions, and gives you runnable examples.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1) What a Stage is (and isn’t)\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **stage** is a Snowflake object that points to a location to **load from** or **unload to** (internal Snowflake storage or an external bucket). You reference it with `@...` in SQL. \n",
    "* Types you’ll use:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **User stage** `@~` (personal scratch space).\n",
    "  * **Table stage** `@%table_name` (tightly coupled to one table).\n",
    "  * **Named stage** `@db.schema.stage` (shared, governed, best for production). \n",
    "* Internal vs External:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Internal stage**: storage fully managed by Snowflake.\n",
    "  * **External stage**: pointer to S3 / Azure Blob / GCS, usually via a **storage integration** (preferred over embedding keys). \n",
    "> ✅ Mental model\n",
    "> Stage = **where** files live + some defaults.\n",
    "> File format = **how** to interpret files (CSV/JSON/Parquet options, etc.). (Details in §4–5.)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2) Fixing a common naming misconception\n",
    "\n",
    "You wrote:\n",
    "`DESC stage [db_name].external_stages.[stage_name] / [db_name].internal_stages.[stage_name]`\n",
    "\n",
    "In Snowflake, a fully-qualified stage name is **`<db>.<schema>.<stage_name>`**. Schemas like `external_stages` or `internal_stages` are just *conventions* you might adopt—not special namespaces. So you’d run, for example:\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "DESC STAGE analytics_stg.raw_landing.vendor_drop;\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DESC STAGE analytics_stg.raw_landing.vendor_drop;\n",
    "```\n",
