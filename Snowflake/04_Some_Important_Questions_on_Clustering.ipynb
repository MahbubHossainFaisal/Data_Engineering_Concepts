    "## 🧠 PART 1: What is Clustering in Snowflake?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❄️ Fundamentals First:\n",
    "\n",
    "In Snowflake, data is **automatically divided into Micro Partitions** (MPs). Each MP is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Immutable\n",
    "* \\~16MB in compressed size\n",
    "* Contains **metadata** about the range of values in its columns (min, max, null count, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 But **as data grows**, and if queries frequently **filter on certain columns** (e.g., `city`, `order_date`), Snowflake might have to **scan too many MPs** — which makes queries slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s where **Clustering** comes in.\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🎯 **Clustering** is the process of **organizing data in MPs so that rows with similar values in the clustering columns stay close together** — making filters and pruning faster!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🌳 PART 2: What is a Micro Partition Tree? How Does Snowflake Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 Think of MPs Like a Library Book Index Tree\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are in a massive **library** and need to find a book by author **\"J.K. Rowling\"**. There are 100,000 books scattered across rooms.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if the books were **sorted by author**, you could:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Walk into the “J” section 📘\n",
    "2. Narrow it to “J.K.”\n",
    "3. Land at “Rowling”\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake does this exact thing behind the scenes using a **metadata tree** for MPs — often thought of as a **binary search tree or index** where:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The root node checks: *Is `order_date < 2023-01-01`?*\n",
    "* If yes → go left (older MPs)\n",
    "* If no → go right (newer MPs)\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🔺 **Micro Partition Depth** is the number of hops it takes in this metadata tree to find your data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **shallow tree** = fewer hops = faster query\n",
    "* A **deep tree** = more hops = slower query\n",

    "COPY INTO orders FROM @stage/orders_batch.csv;\n",

    "\n",
    "Now imagine switching to **Kafka + Snowpipe Streaming**. You get 100 rows **per second**, unordered!\n",
    "\n",
    "Rows from different cities, times, and restaurants get **scattered** across MPs.\n",
    "\n",
    "This makes clustering worse, because MPs contain **random ranges**, like:\n",

    "## 🧠 PART 4: Manual vs Auto Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Manual Clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "You define a **CLUSTER BY** clause when creating a table:\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE orders RECLUSTER;\n",

    "## ✅ **Q1: What happens internally when you define `CLUSTER BY city`?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you define `CLUSTER BY city`, you’re **telling Snowflake to organize future data inserts** so that rows with **similar `city` values are stored closely together within micro partitions (MPs)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "But here's the twist:\n",
    "❗ **Defining `CLUSTER BY` alone does NOT immediately rearrange the data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "### What actually happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Future inserts are **logged** as **eligible for reclustering**.\n",
    "* The table will have a **cluster key** (`city`) registered in its metadata.\n",
    "* If **Auto Clustering is ON**, Snowflake:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Triggers **background reclustering jobs**\n",
    "  * **Rewrites MPs** to co-locate similar `city` values\n",
    "* If Auto Clustering is OFF, you must **manually trigger** this via:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE orders RECLUSTER;\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders (\n",
    "  order_id STRING,\n",
    "  city STRING,\n",
    "  order_date DATE\n",
    ")\n",
    "CLUSTER BY (city);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This setup tells Snowflake:\n",

    "But **only active clustering (manual/auto)** makes this a reality.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ **Q2: How does Snowflake determine which clustering keys to use in auto clustering?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake uses **query history + metadata statistics** to determine **which columns are heavily filtered or joined upon**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📊 It looks at:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Columns most used in:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `GROUP BY`\n",
    "  * Query filters with `BETWEEN`, `=`, `<`, `>`\n",
    "* Query frequency and volume\n",
    "* Cardinality of columns\n",
    "* Data skew (distribution of values)\n",

    "1. **No heavy filtering is done on specific columns**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * E.g., full table scans or analytical aggregations\n",

    "2. **The table is small**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * If it has < 500 MB of data, clustering won’t improve performance much\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Insert pattern is random and constant**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Frequent small inserts (e.g., IoT, logs) will **frequently trigger reclustering**, causing **high costs**\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **High-cardinality clustering column**\n",

    "   * Like `user_id`, `transaction_id`, `uuid`, etc.\n",

    "### 🚨 High Cardinality = Bad for Clustering\n",
