    "Before we talk about optimization, let‚Äôs remember **how Snowflake works internally**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data is stored in **Remote Storage** (S3, Azure Blob, GCS).\n",
    "* Data is organized into **Micro-partitions** (16MB compressed chunks).\n",
    "* Queries don‚Äôt scan whole tables ‚Üí they **prune micro-partitions** (skip scanning unnecessary ones).\n",
    "* Compute is done in **Virtual Warehouses (VWHs)**.\n",
    "* Optimizations = \"How can we help Snowflake prune smarter and compute less?\"\n",

    "\n",
    "When your query feels slow, don‚Äôt immediately jump to scaling warehouses. That‚Äôs like hiring 100 workers when 5 smart ones could finish the job if instructions were clearer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, check these areas **step by step**:\n",

    "### 2.1 Complexity of Query\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Ask: *‚ÄúIs this query doing more than it needs to?‚Äù*\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: A BI analyst writes:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT DISTINCT customer_id, customer_name, region, COUNT(*) \n",
    "FROM customers c\n",
    "JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\n",
    "JOIN payments p ON o.order_id = p.order_id\n",
    "WHERE region = 'APAC'\n",
    "GROUP BY customer_id, customer_name, region;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `DISTINCT` + `GROUP BY` = duplication of effort.\n",
    "* Multiple joins ‚Üí not all needed.\n",

    "Fix: Remove redundancy:\n",

    "### 2.2 Unnecessary Joins or Aggregations\n",
    "\n",
    "Case: A data scientist joins 6 tables but only uses 3 of them in SELECT.\n",
    "üëâ Teach your brain: *If you don‚Äôt need it, don‚Äôt join it.*\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "### 2.3 Query Profile (Where‚Äôs the time spent?)\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake provides a **Query Profile graph**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Green = Scanning.\n",
    "* Purple = Joining.\n",
    "* Yellow = Aggregating.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Suppose 80% of time is in **JOIN step** ‚Üí maybe join keys aren‚Äôt aligned.\n",
    "üëâ Suppose 70% is in **SCAN step** ‚Üí maybe poor partition pruning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Always look here before guessing.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.4 Join Keys with Duplicates\n",
    "\n",
    "Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `orders` table has duplicate `order_id` rows.\n",
    "* You join with `order_items`.\n",
    "  üëâ This explodes into millions of rows unexpectedly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solution: Deduplicate first with `ROW_NUMBER()` or `QUALIFY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2.5 Cartesian Joins\n",
    "\n",
    "A Cartesian join happens when no `ON` condition exists (or wrong key used).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: 1M rows √ó 1M rows ‚Üí 1 trillion rows.\n",
    "  üëâ Always double-check join conditions.\n",

    "\n",
    "### 2.6 Other Issues (Must-know)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Functions in WHERE** ‚Üí avoid wrapping columns inside functions (`DATE(created_at)`), instead rewrite (`created_at BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-01-31'`).\n",

    "# üóÉÔ∏è Chapter 3: Storage Considerations\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where your question about **Automatic Clustering, Search Optimization Service, and Materialized Views** fits in.\n",
    "\n",
    "But before we jump:\n",
    "üëâ You asked: *‚ÄúWhere does data get ordered/changed ‚Äî Remote Storage or Micro-partition layer?‚Äù*\n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data in **Remote Storage** is immutable.\n",
    "* Once ingested, Snowflake chops it into **Micro-partitions**.\n",
    "* Optimizations (clustering, search optimization, materialized views) **don‚Äôt rewrite your storage files**, they influence **how new micro-partitions are created and how metadata is used to prune/locate them**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So think: **Remote storage = frozen lake. Metadata + micro-partitions = map that tells Snowflake where to fish.**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.1 Automatic Clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose: Keep data **physically organized** in micro-partitions along chosen columns (like `region`, `date`).\n",
    "* Without clustering ‚Üí queries may scan many partitions.\n",
    "* With clustering ‚Üí Snowflake automatically reorganizes new micro-partitions to align with clustering keys.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* `sales` table = 10TB.\n",
    "* Queries mostly filter `WHERE order_date BETWEEN ...`.\n",
    "* Without clustering ‚Üí Snowflake scans 10TB every time.\n",
    "* With clustering ‚Üí Micro-partitions neatly follow date ranges ‚Üí pruning reduces scan to \\~500GB.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ But clustering costs compute. Only enable if pruning benefit >> cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.2 Search Optimization Service (SOS)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose: Speed up **point lookups** or highly selective filters.\n",
    "* Example: Query = `WHERE customer_email = 'abc@gmail.com'`.\n",
    "* Normally Snowflake scans many micro-partitions ‚Üí slow.\n",
    "* SOS builds extra metadata index-like structures ‚Üí lets Snowflake jump directly to the partition.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Key: Great for **high-cardinality columns** (emails, IDs), not for low-cardinality (gender = 'M').\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3.3 Materialized Views\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose: Store **pre-computed results** of a query (unlike normal views).\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE MATERIALIZED VIEW mv_monthly_sales AS\n",
    "SELECT region, month(order_date), SUM(amount)\n",
    "FROM sales\n",
    "GROUP BY region, month(order_date);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* When user queries:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM mv_monthly_sales WHERE region='APAC';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Üí Instantly served (since result pre-computed).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Snowflake keeps it fresh automatically when base table changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Downside: Extra storage + compute to maintain. Use for **frequently queried aggregations**.\n",

    "# üõ†Ô∏è Chapter 4: Missing but Important Concepts\n",
    "\n",
    "You didn‚Äôt mention these, but they‚Äôre **critical in Snowflake optimization**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.1 Result Caching\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the exact same query runs again ‚Üí results served instantly from cache (no compute).\n",
    "* Best practice: Ensure queries are written consistently (no unnecessary timestamps like `CURRENT_TIMESTAMP` that break caching).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.2 Metadata & Partition Pruning\n",
    "\n",
    "* Always filter on columns that Snowflake can prune (like dates, IDs).\n",
    "* Bad: `WHERE YEAR(order_date)=2024`.\n",
    "* Good: `WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-01-01' AND '2024-12-31'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.3 Warehouse Sizing: Scale Up vs Scale Out\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Scale Up**: Increase warehouse size (more CPU/memory) ‚Üí good for single large queries.\n",
    "* **Scale Out**: Add more clusters ‚Üí good for many concurrent users.\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Story: If you‚Äôre building one giant building, hire stronger workers (scale up). If you‚Äôre building 100 houses at the same time, hire more teams (scale out).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4.4 Data Modeling Choices\n",
    "\n",
    "* Snowflake works best with **denormalized schemas** for analytics (star schema).\n",
    "* Over-joining normalized schemas = slow queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# üß≠ Chapter 5: Practice Scenarios\n",

    "1. Query is slow. Query Profile shows **90% scan time**.\n",
    "   üëâ What‚Äôs your fix? (*Clustering or partition pruning optimization*)\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Query is slow. Query Profile shows **80% join time**.\n",

    "* **Query optimization** starts with simplifying SQL and analyzing Query Profile.\n",
    "* **Storage optimization** happens in micro-partitions (not raw remote storage). Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Automatic Clustering ‚Üí better partition pruning.\n",
    "  * SOS ‚Üí faster point lookups.\n",
    "  * Materialized Views ‚Üí pre-computed results.\n",
    "* Don‚Äôt forget **caching, warehouse scaling, and pruning strategies**.\n",
    "* Always think: ‚ÄúAm I reducing **data scanned** or **data processed**?‚Äù\n",
