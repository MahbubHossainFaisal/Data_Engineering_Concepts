    "\n",
    "Imagine you run **SnowMart**, a massive online marketplace. On **Black Friday**, you‚Äôve got:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **100 analysts** running dashboards to check sales trends.\n",
    "* **50 data engineers** running ELT pipelines to load clickstream and order data.\n",
    "* **Marketing team** doing heavy historical analysis for customer targeting.\n",
    "\n",
    "All of this is happening **at the same time**‚Ä¶ and the CEO wants results *yesterday*.\n",
    "If Snowflake didn‚Äôt handle **concurrency** and **ACID transactions** well, chaos would reign:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Half-loaded tables.\n",
    "* Wrong aggregation results.\n",
    "* Two analysts looking at different versions of ‚Äútoday‚Äôs sales‚Äù at the same moment.\n",
    "* Pipelines overwriting each other‚Äôs changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is where **Concurrency Control** + **ACID** principles become your **superheroes**.\n",

    "\n",
    "## **Step 2 ‚Äì Fundamentals of ACID Transactions**\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID = **Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability**.\n",
    "Think of it like the **four golden rules** to keep your data trustworthy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. Atomicity** ‚Äì *\"All or Nothing\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you order 3 items online, you either get all 3 confirmed or none at all. No ‚Äúhalf orders.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example in Snowflake:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "INSERT INTO orders VALUES (101, 'Laptop', 1200);\n",
    "INSERT INTO orders VALUES (102, 'Mouse', 20);\n",
    "-- Something fails here\n",
    "ROLLBACK; -- Both inserts are undone\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Story:** Your payment failed on the third item. Snowflake ensures **no partial data** is left.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Consistency** ‚Äì *\"Rules are always respected\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "The database moves from one **valid state** to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** If a `quantity` column must always be positive, Snowflake won‚Äôt commit a transaction that violates this.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "BEGIN;\n",
    "INSERT INTO inventory VALUES (2001, -5); -- Invalid\n",
    "COMMIT; -- Fails, constraint violated\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Story:** You can‚Äôt have negative stock for ‚ÄúChocolate Bars‚Äù no matter how much your diet wants it.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Isolation** ‚Äì *\"No peeking into my transaction\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple users can work at the same time, but **transactions don‚Äôt interfere**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example in Snowflake:**\n",
    "Two users insert into the same table simultaneously ‚Äî each works in **its own snapshot** of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Durability** ‚Äì *\"Once done, always done\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "If you commit, even a system crash won‚Äôt undo it.\n",

    "* Uses **multi-version concurrency control (MVCC)**.\n",
    "* Each query sees a **consistent snapshot** of data.\n",

    "### **How Snowflake does it:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses **MVCC** ‚Üí Each transaction works on a snapshot of the data as of the start time.\n",
    "* Readers never block writers, and writers never block readers.\n",

    "### **Real Concurrency Scenarios & Snowflake‚Äôs Behavior**\n",

    "* Analyst runs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT SUM(sales) FROM orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data engineer runs:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "INSERT INTO orders VALUES (200, 'Monitor', 300);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Snowflake Behavior:**\n",
    "The SELECT query still sees the **old snapshot** without the new row, avoiding ‚Äúdirty reads.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario 2 ‚Äì Write vs Write**\n",
    "\n",
    "Two engineers update the same order:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Engineer A\n",
    "UPDATE orders SET price = 500 WHERE id = 200;\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Engineer B\n",
    "UPDATE orders SET price = 550 WHERE id = 200;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Snowflake Behavior:**\n",
    "Second transaction **fails** with a write conflict error.\n",
    "Snowflake says: ‚ÄúSomeone already committed a change to this row since your transaction started. Please retry.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario 3 ‚Äì Heavy Concurrent Reads**\n",

    "\n",
    "**Snowflake‚Äôs Trick:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Spins up multiple **virtual warehouses** automatically (if auto-scaling enabled).\n",
    "* Each warehouse processes its own set of queries.\n",
    "* No queuing delays unless you max out concurrency limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Scenario 4 ‚Äì ETL Overwriting**\n",
    "\n",
    "If an ELT job truncates and reloads a table while dashboards are reading it, dashboards still see the **old snapshot** until the job commits.\n",
    "No broken dashboards.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Explain how Snowflake ensures ACID properties even in a multi-cluster environment.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Snowflake ensures ACID by combining **immutable storage**, **metadata-driven commits**, and **Multi-Version Concurrency Control (MVCC)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Atomicity:** All changes in a transaction are written to new micro-partitions but only become ‚Äúvisible‚Äù when the metadata pointer switches during `COMMIT`. If the transaction fails, Snowflake simply discards those new partitions ‚Äî no partial changes remain.\n",
    "* **Consistency:** All transactions respect defined constraints (e.g., NOT NULL, UNIQUE). If any rule is violated, the commit fails, ensuring data integrity.\n",
    "* **Isolation:** MVCC ensures each transaction works on its own consistent snapshot. Readers see the version as it existed when they started the query, unaffected by uncommitted changes.\n",
    "* **Durability:** Once committed, metadata and new partitions are persisted in cloud storage (S3, Azure Blob, GCS), making them crash-proof.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Multi-cluster twist:**\n",
    "Even if multiple clusters are processing queries at the same time, they all pull from the same **centralized metadata service**. This ensures every cluster works with the correct version of the data.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Give an example of a violation of one ACID property and how Snowflake prevents it.**\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Example: **Atomicity Violation**\n",

    "COMMIT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You might end up with only the first row committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**How Snowflake prevents it:**\n",
    "Snowflake writes both rows to **temporary micro-partitions** first. If the commit is successful, the metadata pointer switches to the new partitions in one atomic action. If the commit fails, the temporary partitions are discarded.\n",

    "\n",
    "**What happens if two Snowflake transactions try to update the same record at the same time?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Snowflake uses **write conflict detection**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* If Transaction A updates a record and commits before Transaction B commits, Snowflake checks whether Transaction B‚Äôs snapshot is outdated for that row.\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Snowflake avoids traditional row-level locking by using **MVCC**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Every transaction reads from a **snapshot** of the table as of the transaction start time.\n",
    "* Writers don‚Äôt block readers, because readers are reading older snapshots.\n",
