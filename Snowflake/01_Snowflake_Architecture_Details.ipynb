    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚öôÔ∏è **How It Works (Deep Dive):**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Micro-partitioning**: Snowflake automatically breaks your data into **immutable micro-partitions**, each \\~50‚Äì500 MB compressed.\n",
    "* **Columnar format**: Only the needed columns are scanned during query.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **How does Snowflake store structured vs. semi-structured data?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üìò **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Structured data** (tables with columns like `INT`, `VARCHAR`, `DATE`) is stored in **compressed, columnar format** inside **micro-partitions** (50‚Äì500 MB each).\n",
    "* **Semi-structured data** (like JSON, Avro, XML, ORC, Parquet) is stored using **VARIANT**, a flexible column type.\n",
    "  Internally, Snowflake **flattens and tokenizes** this semi-structured data into a columnar format as well, so it benefits from column pruning, compression, and partitioning just like structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "üì¶ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE logs (\n",
    "    id INT,\n",
    "    payload VARIANT\n",
    ");\n",

    "You can query `payload:data.city` just like a normal column.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **What are micro-partitions, and how do they affect performance?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Micro-partitions are **immutable, compressed blocks** of data.\n",
    "* Snowflake automatically **creates and manages** them ‚Äî you never manually partition your tables.\n",
    "* Each partition contains **metadata**: min/max values for each column, null counts, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîç **Why does it matter?**\n",
    "When you query, Snowflake checks metadata first to decide which partitions to scan.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìå Example:\n",
    "If you're querying for `YEAR = 2024` and some micro-partitions have only data from `2022`, they‚Äôre **completely skipped**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called **partition pruning**, and it boosts performance massively.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Can you access raw files in Snowflake storage?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üö´ **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "No, **you cannot directly access Snowflake‚Äôs internal storage**.\n",
    "\n",
    "It‚Äôs abstracted away completely. You work through:\n",
    "\n",
    "* SQL (Tables, VARIANT columns)\n",
    "* **External stages** (to load/unload from S3, GCS, Azure)\n",
    "* Views & pipes\n",
    "\n",
    "üìò If you want file-like access, you use **staging areas** like:\n",

    "CREATE STAGE mystage URL='s3://mybucket/';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "#### 4. **What happens to data when you drop a table?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üóëÔ∏è **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Snowflake doesn‚Äôt immediately delete the data!\n",
    "* Instead, it marks it as ‚Äúdropped‚Äù and keeps it for the **Time Travel period** (default: 1 day, max: 90 days).\n",
    "* During Time Travel, you can **recover** the table using:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UNDROP TABLE your_table;\n",

    "* **Warehouse size** (XS to 6XL): Defines the **power** (CPU, memory, I/O bandwidth) of a single compute cluster.\n",
    "* **Cluster count** (in multi-cluster warehouses): Defines the number of **independent clusters** that can be spun up **in parallel** to handle **high-concurrency** workloads.\n",

    "üèãÔ∏è Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Large` warehouse = more power (better for heavy queries).\n",

    "If many users hit the same warehouse at the same time:\n",

    "* Snowflake can **queue queries** (on single-cluster warehouse)\n",
    "* Or **auto-scale** horizontally (if multi-cluster is enabled)\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 7. **How are warehouses billed?**\n",
    "\n",
    "üí≥ **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Billing is **per-second**, rounded up to a **60-second minimum** per use.\n",
    "* You pay for **running time**, not for query time.\n",
    "* A warehouse can be set to **auto-suspend** after X seconds of inactivity and **auto-resume** when needed.\n",

    "üìò Example:\n",

    "\n",
    "‚è∏Ô∏è **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Paused warehouse** = not running, not consuming compute credits.\n",
    "* When you run a query on a paused warehouse, **Cloud Services layer automatically resumes it**.\n",

    "* Snowflake supports **ACID-compliant** transactions.\n",
    "* It uses **MVCC (Multi-Version Concurrency Control)**.\n",
    "* Each transaction sees a **snapshot** of the data as it was at the start of the transaction.\n",
