    "* **Micro-partitions & pruning** (very fast scanning / min/max metadata) — Snowflake stores column min/max and can prune partitions. This massively reduces scan cost for selective filters. ([Snowflake Documentation][10])\n",
    "* **Clustering, time travel, cloning, DML, materialized views on tables** — advanced features you don’t get on stage reads or (some of) external tables. ([Snowflake Documentation][4])\n",
    "* **Faster repeated queries via micro-partition caching** and more cost-efficient compute for analytical workloads. ([Teej][11])\n",
    "\n",
    "### What stage / external reads **lack** or are weaker at:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **No micro-partition pruning** because files are not loaded into Snowflake’s micro-partition storage — queries must re-scan/parsing files (slower for heavy analytic workloads). ([Stack Overflow][7])\n",
    "* **Less pushdown & metadata**: stage queries return positional columns (\\$1,\\$2) unless you wrap them or use external tables to define columns. External tables can add metadata but still won’t have micro-partitions. ([Snowflake Documentation][6])\n",
    "* **No materialized views directly on stage queries** (external tables can have materialized views in some cases, but there are caveats). ([Medium][9])\n",

    "* **Single source of truth / interoperability** — other systems can read the same S3 files.\n",

    "* **Limited Snowflake features**: no micro-partitioning, no time travel, no cloning, limited materialized view options, some DDL/DML limitations. ([Snowflake Documentation][4])\n",
    "* **Metadata maintenance**: external tables require refreshes (manual or event-driven) to reflect new/removed files; auto-refresh costs (Snowpipe charges) can appear. ([Snowflake Documentation][4])\n",

    "# 9) Can I query *only* the S3 files I added to the Integration?\n",
    "\n",
    "Short answer: **No single magic permission in the integration alone controls the exact files — three things must align**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Stage URL / external table LOCATION** — the stage or external table points to a specific bucket/path (that's your first limit). You can only query files under that stage path. ([Snowflake Documentation][4])\n",
    "2. **Storage Integration `STORAGE_ALLOWED_LOCATIONS`** — on the Snowflake side you can restrict allowed S3 URIs for that integration; stage URLs must align to those locations. ([Snowflake Documentation][3])\n",
    "3. **AWS IAM role / bucket policy** — AWS must grant the Snowflake role `s3:ListBucket` / `s3:GetObject` for the specific bucket & prefixes. If the IAM policy does not allow a prefix, Snowflake cannot read it even if the integration lists it. ([Snowflake Documentation][5])\n",
    "\n",

    "* For quick inspection: create FILE FORMAT + STAGE → `LIST` → `SELECT $1,$2... FROM @stage(...)` (good for QA). ([Snowflake Documentation][2])\n",
