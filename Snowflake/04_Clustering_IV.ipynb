    "If your books are just dumped randomly, your librarian (Snowflake) must check **every book on every shelf** to find the right ones ‚Äî expensive and slow.\n",
    "\n",
    "But what if books were **clustered (grouped)** by *Author* and then *Year*? Now your librarian knows **exactly which shelves** to go to. That‚Äôs the magic of **Clustering in Snowflake**. It organizes the data in micro-partitions **based on the values of specific columns** ‚Äî the *clustering keys*.\n",

    "\n",
    "## üìò **Chapter 2: Micro-Partitions ‚Äî The Pages of Our Story**\n",

    "Before we choose clustering keys, understand where this clustering happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Snowflake stores data in **micro-partitions** (like virtual blocks).\n",
    "* Each micro-partition contains **compressed columnar data** and metadata like min/max values.\n",

    "\n",
    "Real-world example:\n",
    "\n",
    "### üì¶ Scenario:\n",
    "\n",
    "You're an e-commerce company. You store orders with these fields:\n",
    "\n",
    "| ORDER\\_ID | CUSTOMER\\_ID | ORDER\\_DATE | REGION | AMOUNT |\n",
    "| --------- | ------------ | ----------- | ------ | ------ |\n",
    "\n",
    "You load data daily based on `ORDER_DATE`.\n",

    "Initially, queries like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE ORDER_DATE = '2024-01-01'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "work great ‚Äî Snowflake prunes well because the data is naturally ordered.\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM orders WHERE CUSTOMER_ID = 'C10029'\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the problem begins ‚Äî because your data isn't ordered by `CUSTOMER_ID`, Snowflake **scans more partitions**, leading to **performance issues**.\n",

    "This is where your main question comes in. Let's go point by point from your input:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **1. Columns Often Used in WHERE Clauses**\n",
    "\n",
    "These are your **search filters**. If you're always filtering by `REGION`, `CUSTOMER_ID`, or `ORDER_DATE`, they are great candidates.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why?**\n",
    "Because clustering improves **partition pruning**, which speeds up such queries.\n",

    "üß† Think:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ‚ÄúWhat filters appear in most of our slow queries?‚Äù\n",
    "* Run **query profiling** or analyze **query history** in Snowsight to find that.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **2. Columns Used in JOIN Conditions**\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're joining large tables and a join key is not clustered, Snowflake **scans more partitions**, which increases cost and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "üìñ **Story Example:**\n",
    "You're joining `orders` and `customers` on `CUSTOMER_ID`. If both tables are clustered by `CUSTOMER_ID`, the join performance **improves significantly**, especially for **range joins or filters after the join**.\n",
    "\n",

    "### üß† Why Is This Important?\n",

    "Because Snowflake **recommends clustering from LOW ‚Üí HIGH cardinality**.\n",
    "\n",

    "üîÅ **Because clustering is like grouping shelves in a library:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Grouping first by `GENDER` ‚Üí fewer groups (shelves).\n",
    "* Then within `GENDER`, by `REGION`.\n",
    "* Then by `CUSTOMER_ID` ‚Äî which further narrows down the location.\n",

    "* Compressed,\n",
    "* Columnar storage units,\n",
