    "# 1) What is Time Travel? (fundamentals + story)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Plain explanation:** Time Travel keeps historical versions of table data for a configured retention period so you can query, clone, or restore past states of objects (tables, schemas, databases) — i.e., inspect or recover data as of a point in the past. This works for SELECT (query history), CLONE, and UNDROP (restore dropped objects). ([Snowflake Docs][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Story:** When your colleague ran `UPDATE PROD.CUSTOMER SET status = 'inactive'` with a missing `WHERE`, Snowflake stored the previous state for every changed micro-partition. You can now query the table *as it was* before that update (within the retention window) and either copy data back or restore the entire table.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2) Retention period — what it means (and limits)\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data retention period (Time Travel window):** number of days Snowflake keeps historical versions for Time Travel. Default is **1 day (24 hours)** for most accounts; Enterprise & above can have extended retention (up to 90 days for permanent tables). A retention of **0** disables Time Travel for that object. ([Snowflake Docs][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Fail-safe:** After Time Travel retention ends, Snowflake keeps data for a further **7 days** as part of Fail-Safe for permanent tables — it’s only for Snowflake internal recovery and **cannot** be used by users for Time Travel queries. (Important: Fail-Safe is a recovery window, not a user feature.) ([Snowflake Docs][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Temporary / Transient tables:** Have different behavior — transient tables have no Fail-Safe and limited Time Travel (check docs), temporary tables are session-scoped. Don’t assume full Time Travel is available for these. ([Snowflake Docs][3])\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 3) How to check an object’s Time Travel retention\n",
    "\n",
    "You can inspect Data Retention settings at different object levels (account, database, schema, table). Useful commands:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Check table parameter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS' IN TABLE my_db.my_schema.my_table;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* Or schema / database level:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS' IN SCHEMA my_db.my_schema;\n",
    "SHOW PARAMETERS LIKE 'DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS' IN DATABASE my_db;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This shows the parameter and where it’s set (object level vs inherited). (Community tips + docs recommend this approach.) ([Stack Overflow][4])\n",
    "\n",
    "* Quick check of table metadata:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DESC TABLE my_db.my_schema.my_table;\n",
    "-- or\n",
    "SHOW TABLES IN SCHEMA my_db.my_schema LIKE 'my_table';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "(These help inspect attributes and visibility; exact retention is via SHOW PARAMETERS above.) ([Snowflake Docs][5])\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 4) Can I UNDROP a table/schema/database?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Yes — if** the object was dropped within the Time Travel retention period. Use `UNDROP`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "UNDROP TABLE my_db.my_schema.my_table;\n",
    "-- or to recover the most recently dropped table with the same name under the same schema\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Important points:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `UNDROP` relies on Time Travel. If the retention window expired, UNDROP will fail. ([Snowflake Docs][6])\n",
    "* UNDROP restores the most recent dropped version (you can list versions via `SHOW TABLES` history or `TABLES` INFORMATION_SCHEMA views to find dropped versions). If multiple drops/recreates happened, you may need to examine the object history. ([Stack Overflow][7])\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 5) `CREATE OR REPLACE` — why it breaks Time Travel for prior data\n",
    "\n",
    "`CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE` **drops** the existing table and creates a new one immediately. That drop is destructive for the original object identity: Time Travel can’t present the old table under the same name after `CREATE OR REPLACE` because you effectively created a new object. If you need to remove table rows while preserving historical state, **don’t** use `CREATE OR REPLACE`; prefer `TRUNCATE` or `DELETE` (Time Travel retains history of those operations). Practical note: `CREATE OR REPLACE` removes the link to the previous object's Time Travel history. ([Stack Overflow][8])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Rule of thumb:** Use `CREATE OR REPLACE` only when you truly intend to replace the object and discard prior state.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "# 6) Querying a table as it was 5 minutes ago (AT / BEFORE / OFFSET)\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake provides `AT` and `BEFORE` clauses to request the historical state. There are a few time specifiers: `TIMESTAMP`, `STATEMENT`, and `OFFSET` (seconds back relative to now).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:** see the table as it was 5 minutes (300 seconds) ago:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM my_db.my_schema.my_table\n",
    "AT (OFFSET => -60*5);   -- -60*5 = -300 seconds => 5 minutes ago\n",

    "or (explicit seconds)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM my_db.my_schema.my_table\n",
    "AT (OFFSET => -300);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `AT` is inclusive of changes with exactly that time; `BEFORE` gives state just before that time/statement. Use the `AT | BEFORE` docs for behavior nuances. ([Snowflake Docs][9])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Alternative with TIMESTAMP:** If you know exact timestamp:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT *\n",
    "FROM my_db.my_schema.my_table\n",
    "AT (TIMESTAMP => '2025-10-18 10:15:00'::timestamp);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Using STATEMENT:** If you have a previous query’s statement ID, you can use `STATEMENT => '<query_id>'` to fetch state at that transaction boundary.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Option A — Create a backup table from historical snapshot (fast, read-only historical query)**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Create a backup table from 10 minutes ago:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "\n",
    "Story: After the near miss, you put these practices in place so it never happens (or is easy to fix) again.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retention strategy by environment**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Production/permanent tables: keep Time Travel > 1 day (business-dependent). For Enterprise accounts, consider 7–30 days depending on RPO and cost.\n",
    "   * Development / transient tables: set lower retention (0–1 day) to save storage costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Never use `CREATE OR REPLACE` in prod to remove rows** — use `TRUNCATE` if you want to empty a table but keep history available for rollback. `CREATE OR REPLACE` will break access to historical versions. ([Stack Overflow][8])\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Automated pre-flight backup before mass DML**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Before large updates/deletes, automatically create a **snapshot/clone**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE my_schema.orders_preupdate_clone CLONE my_schema.orders;\n",
    "-- or\n",
    "CREATE TABLE my_schema.orders_preupdate_backup AS SELECT * FROM my_schema.orders AT (OFFSET => -1);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Use zero-copy CLONE for quick snapshots** (cheap, fast) and use CTAS for immutable backup copies if you prefer independence.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Document and require change approval for any job that runs DDL/DML at scale** — include a step that creates a clone or backup automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Use role separation & guarded scripts** — require higher privilege and a confirmation step for destructive queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Monitor Time Travel storage costs** — older versions consume storage; balance retention window vs cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. **Test UNDROP and recovery workflows in non-prod** — practice makes you fast when real incidents happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **For truncation restore pattern** (from your input): to back up before `TRUNCATE`:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Create backup via time travel or clone.\n",

    "* **Temporary and transient tables**: different retention and fail-safe behavior — usually not suitable for long-term recovery. ([Snowflake Docs][3])\n",

    "Before large modifications, create a **zero-copy clone**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE orders_backup CLONE orders;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",

    "UPDATE orders\n",
    "SET status = 'INACTIVE'\n",
    "WHERE region = 'WEST';\n",

    "* **Time Travel** gives you *historical access*.\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE orders_clone CLONE orders AT (OFFSET => -3600);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates `orders_clone` exactly as `orders` looked 1 hour ago — instantly and without duplicating storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key properties:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clones share underlying micro-partitions → almost no cost initially.\n",
    "* Any change after cloning creates new micro-partitions only for changed data.\n",
    "* You can also clone entire **schemas** or **databases**.\n",

    "**Real use case:**\n",
    "Before running a massive transformation pipeline, clone the production database:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE DATABASE prod_clone CLONE prod AT (TIMESTAMP => current_timestamp());\n",
