    "### ‚ùì **1. What happens if multiple users run queries on a Small warehouse?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "If the number of concurrent queries exceeds the capacity of the Small warehouse, the **excess queries will queue** until others finish.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A Small warehouse has **limited compute resources** ‚Äî let‚Äôs say (hypothetically) it can handle 8 queries at a time.\n",
    "* If 12 users run queries simultaneously:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * 8 run immediately.\n",
    "  * 4 are **queued** until resources free up.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake handles this queuing **automatically**. No queries fail ‚Äî just delayed.\n",

    "\n",
    "> \"Snowflake auto-scales the warehouse size automatically to handle this.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Incorrect.** Snowflake will **NOT** resize your warehouse automatically.\n",
    "Only **multi-cluster warehouses** can scale horizontally to handle more concurrent queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìò Real-World Analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine a restaurant kitchen with 2 chefs. They can prepare 2 dishes at a time.\n",
    "If 5 orders come in at once, only 2 dishes start cooking ‚Äî the other 3 wait.\n",
    "That‚Äôs exactly what a Small warehouse does.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Fix: Use a **Multi-Cluster Warehouse** with auto-scaling for concurrency problems.\n",

    "### ‚ùì **2. Can a warehouse resize itself automatically?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "**No**, a warehouse **cannot resize itself automatically** from Small ‚Üí Medium ‚Üí Large.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Snowflake doesn‚Äôt support **automatic vertical scaling**.\n",
    "* If you want to resize a warehouse:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * You must manually change its size.\n",
    "  * You must suspend it first, then change the size, then resume.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER WAREHOUSE my_wh SUSPEND;\n",
    "ALTER WAREHOUSE my_wh SET WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'MEDIUM';\n",
    "ALTER WAREHOUSE my_wh RESUME;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This causes a short downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Misconception:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ÄúSnowflake is cloud-native, so it must auto-resize compute like AWS Lambda or Kubernetes.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "**Wrong assumption.** Snowflake warehouses are **user-defined compute allocations**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Fix: For dynamic scaling, use **Multi-Cluster** (horizontal scaling), not size resizing.\n",

    "### ‚ùì **3. How do multi-cluster warehouses help reduce queuing?**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **Correct Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "Multi-cluster warehouses **add more clusters automatically** when concurrency increases, thus **reducing query queuing**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You define a **MIN\\_CLUSTER\\_COUNT** and **MAX\\_CLUSTER\\_COUNT**.\n",
    "* Snowflake starts with `min` number of clusters.\n",
    "* When concurrent queries spike and the main cluster is saturated, Snowflake:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Adds more **clusters (same size)** up to `max`.\n",
    "* Each new cluster can handle another batch of queries **in parallel**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìò Real Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE WAREHOUSE dashboard_wh\n",
    "  WAREHOUSE_SIZE = 'SMALL'\n",
    "  MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1\n",
    "  MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT = 3;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If 20 queries hit at once:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cluster 1 takes the first batch.\n",
    "* Cluster 2 and 3 spin up automatically and take the rest ‚Äî **no queuing**!\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Bonus: When traffic reduces, Snowflake **auto-spins down** the extra clusters to save cost.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Vertical scaling** = Increase size of 1 engine = More CPU/Memory\n",
    "  Useful for **long/heavy queries**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Horizontal scaling** = Add more engines = More parallel query execution\n",
    "  Useful for **concurrent users/dashboards**.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Critical Point:\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake **doesn‚Äôt auto-scale vertically**.\n",
    "But it **does auto-scale horizontally** with multi-cluster config.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìò Analogy:\n",
    "\n",

    "### ‚ùì **5. How can you save costs with high concurrency workloads?**\n",

    "Use a **Small warehouse** in **Multi-Cluster Mode** with:\n",

    "* `AUTO_RESUME` enabled\n",
    "* Reasonable `MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT` based on observed concurrency\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Using a **larger warehouse** (like 2X-Large) for high concurrency is wasteful if most queries are small.\n",
    "* Instead, use multiple **Small clusters**, scaling out only when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "This way:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You **only pay for extra clusters when traffic spikes**\n",
    "* Each cluster **auto-suspends** when idle\n",
    "* You control max limits with `MAX_CLUSTER_COUNT`\n",
    "\n",
