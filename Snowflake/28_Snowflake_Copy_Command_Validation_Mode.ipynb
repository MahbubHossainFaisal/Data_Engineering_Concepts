    "Imagine you just joined a data engineering team at a top tech company, and your first assignment is: **‚ÄúBefore loading terabytes of CSV data into our Snowflake warehouse, make sure the files are clean.‚Äù**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, if you‚Äôre a beginner, you might think: ‚ÄúWell, I‚Äôll just run the `COPY INTO` command and see what happens. If there are errors, I‚Äôll fix them later.‚Äù\n",

    "* Do my file columns match the table‚Äôs DDL?\n",
    "* Are there malformed rows?\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. `VALIDATION_MODE = RETURN_ERRORS`\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Think of this as a **‚Äúquality inspector‚Äù** who stops the truck at the warehouse gate and says:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs a list of all the broken boxes in your shipment. I won‚Äôt let them in yet.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "* Purpose: Returns **rows with errors** (parsing errors, type mismatches, etc.) instead of loading data.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. `VALIDATION_MODE = RETURN_ALL_ERRORS`\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Imagine you‚Äôre **auditing every single box** in the shipment.\n",
    "Instead of stopping at the first few, you want to know **every single issue in the entire batch**.\n",

    "## üîπ Step 3: Your Question ‚Äì Does Validation Compare File Columns with Table DDL?\n",
    "\n",
    "‚úÖ Great question!\n",
    "Here‚Äôs the truth: **Validation does two checks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File structure check** ‚Üí Are rows split correctly, columns aligned, delimiters consistent?\n",
    "2. **DDL compatibility check** ‚Üí Can each field be cast into the target table‚Äôs column type?\n",

    "So yes, you were partly correct. But it‚Äôs more than just ‚Äúcolumn count vs table DDL.‚Äù\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If table column is `NUMBER` and file contains ‚Äúabc‚Äù ‚Üí validation fails.\n",
    "* If table expects 5 columns but file has 6 ‚Üí validation fails.\n",

    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs build a case study.\n",

    "üìÇ Suppose you have a staging file:\n",

    "Snowflake gives us **three modes**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **`RETURN_ERRORS`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Shows rows that fail during parsing or casting into the target table.\n",
    "   * Useful when you want to quickly identify a **sample of problematic records**.\n",
    "   * Think of it like the inspector who shows you the **broken boxes at the gate**.\n",

    "   * Think of it like auditing **every single shipment box**, not just the first few.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **`RETURN_5_ROWS`**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Returns 5 rows exactly as Snowflake parses them, regardless of whether they have errors or not.\n",
    "   * Perfect for **previewing file structure** (delimiters, quotes, headers).\n",
    "   * Think of it like **opening 5 random boxes** to check if the shipment is packaged correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **How does Snowflake validation check both file format and table DDL?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Validation works on **two levels**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **File Format Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Checks if Snowflake can properly split rows/columns based on the file format options (delimiter, quotes, escape characters, etc.).\n",
    "   * Example: If delimiter is set as `,` but file is tab-separated, validation will show parsing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Table DDL Compatibility Validation**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Once parsed, Snowflake checks if each column value can fit into the target table column type.\n",
    "   * Example: If table column is `NUMBER` and file has \"abc\", you get a validation error.\n",
    "   * Also checks constraints like **NOT NULL**.\n",
    "\n",
    "So validation ensures both:\n",
    "üëâ **‚ÄúIs the file readable?‚Äù** and üëâ **‚ÄúDoes the data fit into the table definition?‚Äù**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 3. **If you want to see only a preview of rows before loading, which validation mode would you use?**\n",

    "* They included a header row,\n",
    "* Columns are separated by commas or tabs,\n",
    "* Dates are in `YYYY-MM-DD` or `MM/DD/YYYY`.\n",

    "* **`RETURN_ERRORS`**: Returns only a **sample** of errors (not guaranteed all). Quick way to spot common issues.\n",

    "* You forget to set `FIELD_OPTIONALLY_ENCLOSED_BY='\"'`.\n",
    "* Without it, commas inside quoted strings will break parsing.\n",

    "So, validation acts as a **feedback loop** while defining file formats.\n",
