    "\n",

    "### 3. Do you get billed if no query runs?\n",

    "\n",
    "### ✅ Statement 1: One user/account can be assigned to one virtual warehouse or vice versa\n",
    "\n",
    "**Clarification:**\n",
    "In Snowflake:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Any number of users can use a single virtual warehouse**.\n",
    "* **A single user can choose from any number of virtual warehouses** (based on grants/roles).\n",

    "> Warehouses are **shared compute resources**, and they are **not tied to users directly** — instead, they're tied to queries.\n",

    "\n",
    "* A **user chooses a warehouse** at runtime via session or query context.\n",
    "* Multiple users can **concurrently share** the same warehouse.\n",
    "* One warehouse can process **multiple queries from different users** **concurrently**, up to a point.\n",

    "Every virtual warehouse has a **fixed compute capacity**, based on its size:\n",

    "\n",
    "* It can handle 8 concurrent queries max (hypothetical)\n",
    "* 15 queries arrive together\n",
    "* 8 start immediately\n",
    "* 7 will **wait** (queued) until one of the active queries finishes\n",

    "Snowflake does **not support auto-scaling a single warehouse up or down in size** **on demand** like vertical scaling.\n",

    "#### 🔥 Fact:\n",

    "> You have to **manually suspend** the warehouse and then change its size.\n",

    "-- Step 3: Resume it\n",
    "ALTER WAREHOUSE team_wh RESUME;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This may not be suitable for **real-time or live queries**, because suspending will disrupt active sessions.\n",

    "  MIN_CLUSTER_COUNT = 1\n",
