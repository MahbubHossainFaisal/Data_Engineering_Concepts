    "## 1. Let‚Äôs Start with a Story üìñ\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a Data Engineer in a healthcare company. You have **patient medical records** stored as **Parquet/CSV files in AWS S3**.\n",
    "Now your analysts want to run **SQL queries** on those files directly without waiting for you to load them into Snowflake internal tables every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, you think: ‚ÄúOkay, let me just create a stage pointing to S3 and then create a **view** on top of those staged files.‚Äù\n",
    "\n",
    "üëâ Problem: Every time someone queries the view:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Snowflake has to **scan the raw files in S3** again and again.\n",
    "* For large data, multiple joins, or frequent queries ‚Üí **super slow and costly**.\n",
    "* Worst of all, Snowflake **does not know the metadata of those files** (like which files are already processed, which are new).\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° This is where **External Tables** come in like superheroes.\n",
    "They act as a **bridge** between **S3 files** and **Snowflake queries**, keeping metadata cached inside Snowflake to optimize queries.\n",

    "\n",
    "* ‚úÖ **Metadata Awareness**:\n",
    "  External tables maintain a metadata layer inside Snowflake that keeps track of:\n",

    "  * Which files exist in S3\n",
    "  * Which new files appeared\n",
    "  * Which files were updated or removed\n",
    "\n",
    "* ‚úÖ **Avoid Full Scans**:\n",
    "  Instead of re-reading all S3 files every time, Snowflake queries only the **relevant files** based on metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ‚úÖ **Performance Boost**:\n",
    "  With metadata + partition pruning, queries run much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ‚úÖ **Cost Saving**:\n",
    "  Since fewer files are scanned ‚Üí less data processed ‚Üí less credit usage.\n",
