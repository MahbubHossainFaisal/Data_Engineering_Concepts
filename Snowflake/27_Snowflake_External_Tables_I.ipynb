    "# 🌐 External Tables in Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Let’s Start with a Story 📖\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you are a Data Engineer in a healthcare company. You have **patient medical records** stored as **Parquet/CSV files in AWS S3**.\n",
    "Now your analysts want to run **SQL queries** on those files directly without waiting for you to load them into Snowflake internal tables every time.\n",
    "\n",
    "At first, you think: “Okay, let me just create a stage pointing to S3 and then create a **view** on top of those staged files.”\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 Problem: Every time someone queries the view:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Snowflake has to **scan the raw files in S3** again and again.\n",
    "* For large data, multiple joins, or frequent queries → **super slow and costly**.\n",
    "* Worst of all, Snowflake **does not know the metadata of those files** (like which files are already processed, which are new).\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 This is where **External Tables** come in like superheroes.\n",
    "They act as a **bridge** between **S3 files** and **Snowflake queries**, keeping metadata cached inside Snowflake to optimize queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Why Do We Need External Tables?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ **Metadata Awareness**:\n",
    "  External tables maintain a metadata layer inside Snowflake that keeps track of:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Which files exist in S3\n",
    "  * Which new files appeared\n",
    "  * Which files were updated or removed\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ **Avoid Full Scans**:\n",
    "  Instead of re-reading all S3 files every time, Snowflake queries only the **relevant files** based on metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ **Performance Boost**:\n",
    "  With metadata + partition pruning, queries run much faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "* ✅ **Cost Saving**:\n",
    "  Since fewer files are scanned → less data processed → less credit usage.\n",
    "\n",
    "So external tables give us a **database-like experience** on top of raw cloud storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Syntax to Create External Table from S3\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s build step by step 👇\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 1: Create a Stage (pointing to S3 bucket)\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE STAGE my_s3_stage\n",
    "  URL='s3://mybucket/raw-data/'\n",
    "  STORAGE_INTEGRATION = my_s3_integration\n",
    "  FILE_FORMAT = (TYPE = PARQUET);\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "* `URL` → points to your S3 bucket.\n",
    "* `STORAGE_INTEGRATION` → secure way to connect Snowflake to S3.\n",
    "* `FILE_FORMAT` → defines data type (Parquet, CSV, JSON).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 2: Create External Table\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE EXTERNAL TABLE patient_records_ext\n",
    "  (\n",
    "    patient_id STRING AS (value:c1::string),\n",
    "    name STRING AS (value:c2::string),\n",

    "  AUTO_REFRESH = TRUE\n",
    "  PATTERN='.*.parquet';\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "🔎 Breakdown:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Column definitions**: `AS (value:c1::string)` means → take column from file JSON/Parquet field.\n",
    "* **WITH LOCATION**: tells Snowflake where data resides (`@stage`).\n",
    "* **FILE\\_FORMAT**: defines type.\n",
    "* **AUTO\\_REFRESH = TRUE**: Snowflake automatically tracks new files added in S3 (via event notifications).\n",
    "* **PATTERN**: regex to include/exclude files (e.g., only `.parquet` files).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Query the External Table\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM patient_records_ext WHERE age > 50;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This looks like a normal table, but behind the scenes, Snowflake:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Uses **metadata** first (to know which files contain data).\n",
    "* Reads only relevant files from S3.\n",
    "* Returns result quickly.\n",

    "* **AUTO\\_REFRESH**: Needs cloud storage event notifications configured. Without this, you must run `ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE REFRESH`.\n",
    "* **Limitations**:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * External tables are **read-only** (no insert/update/delete).\n",
    "  * Query performance is good, but not as optimized as internal tables.\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ❓ 5. Can you insert/update/delete data in external tables?\n",
    "\n",

    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   → For old files, `diagnosis` will be NULL.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Re-create external table** if schema changes significantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "💡 Best practice: Design columns using `VARIANT` for semi-structured data (JSON/Parquet), so schema changes don’t break queries.\n",

    "Let’s go back to our **healthcare company** example.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Your analyst wants to query **3 years of patient files** in S3.\n",
    "* With a **view on stage** → Snowflake reads all 3 years of files even if query is just for **last 1 month**. Query might take 20 minutes.\n",
    "* With an **external table** partitioned by `year/month/day`, querying last month’s data only scans those files. Query runs in 1 minute.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally:\n",
    "\n",
    "* With a **view** → you can’t check which files are being read.\n",
    "* With an **external table** → you can run:\n",
    "\n",
    "  ```sql\n",
    "  SELECT * FROM TABLE(INFORMATION_SCHEMA.EXTERNAL_TABLE_FILES(TABLE_NAME=>'PATIENT_RECORDS_EXT'));\n",
    "  ```\n",

    "✅ So to summarize:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **View on stage = Simple but dumb** (always scans everything, no metadata).\n",
    "* **External table = Smart layer** (keeps metadata, optimizes scans, tracks files, supports partition pruning).\n",
