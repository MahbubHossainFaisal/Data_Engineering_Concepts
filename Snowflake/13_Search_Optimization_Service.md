- Search Optimization Service
    - Provide a detailed introduction of it
    - In which areas, it improves performance?
    - point lookup queries
    - Once you identify the queries that can benefit from this service,
    you can configure search optimization for the columns and tables used in those queries.

- Explain a real but easy and understandable scenario from the following point of view
    - Where the need of Search optimization search would be needed the most step by step.
    - Why we need Search optimization service inspite of having QAS? Like in which exact scenario,
    QAS would not work and that's why we would need Search optimization service?
    - Could we able to use clustering instead of Search optimization service? If clustering can solve the problem
    then why we need Search Optimization service? If clustering won't be able to solve the issue, why is that?
    What would make us use Search Optimization instead of clustering

- SOS creates extra storage which is seperate than actual table to provide it's service. Explain in details.


- What specifically we should look into a column in order to make it eligible to put it under SOS.
