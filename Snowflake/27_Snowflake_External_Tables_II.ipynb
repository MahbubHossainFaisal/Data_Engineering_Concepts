    "* **What is an external table?**\n",
    "  An external table in Snowflake is a read-only table definition that points to files in external cloud storage (S3 / GCS / Azure Blob). Snowflake stores *file-level metadata* (file names, etag/md5, last modified, registration timestamp, partition info) — but **the data files themselves live outside Snowflake**. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Two ways to keep metadata in sync:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  1. **Manual refresh** (you call it).\n",
    "  2. **Auto refresh** — Snowflake wires an internal Snowpipe pipe to a cloud messaging queue (SQS / Pub/Sub / Event Grid) so events from the storage trigger metadata refreshes. AUTO\\_REFRESH is `TRUE` by default but requires you configure event notifications. ([Snowflake Documentation][2])\n",

    "\n",
    "**Key points you must know (and why folks get surprised):**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Snowflake keeps file-level metadata until you refresh.** If the external table metadata is not refreshed after the deletion, `EXTERNAL_TABLE_FILES` will still show the deleted file as *registered* (Snowflake’s metadata wasn’t updated yet). After you run `ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE ... REFRESH`, the registration history will show an `UNREGISTERED` event for that file. ([Snowflake Documentation][3])\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Even after physical deletion, queries might still return the old rows because of caching — three caches to understand:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Result cache (Cloud Services layer)**: if someone ran the *same* query recently and the result is still in the **result cache** (persisted results), Snowflake will return that cached result instantly without re-scanning files. This makes the query appear to still \"see\" the deleted data. The result cache is used when the query text is identical and Snowflake believes underlying data hasn’t changed. Result cache lives \\~24 hours (with extensions). You can control it with `USE_CACHED_RESULT`. ([Snowflake Documentation][7])\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Metadata cache (Cloud Services layer)**: Snowflake’s cloud control plane caches file metadata (what files are registered). If metadata hasn’t been refreshed, Snowflake still thinks the deleted file exists and will plan to read it. (Refreshing syncs the metadata store.) ([Snowflake Community][8], [Snowflake Documentation][2])\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Warehouse (local) cache (compute layer / SSD)**: when a virtual warehouse previously read a file, it can cache blocks locally. If the same warehouse is still running and the data blocks are in its cache, subsequent queries can read those cached blocks without contacting S3. Note: the warehouse cache is dropped when the warehouse suspends. ([Snowflake Documentation][9])\n",
    "\n",
    "**So when will a query fetch data from the cloud services cache vs remaining S3 files?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **It will return cached results (cloud services result cache) when**: the query text is identical to a recently executed query whose result is still in cache and metadata indicates “no underlying change”. In that case Snowflake doesn’t read files at all (fast, zero compute). ([Snowflake Documentation][7])\n",
    "\n",
    "* **It will read from the warehouse local cache (not contacting S3) when**: the same warehouse previously read that file and the local cache still holds the blocks (warehouse not suspended / cache not evicted). This results in data returned even if S3 file was later deleted — but only for queries executed on that warehouse and while the cache exists. ([Snowflake Documentation][9])\n",
    "\n",
    "* **It will fetch directly from S3 (or skip the file) when**: the query is not using the result cache and the warehouse cache doesn't contain the data. If metadata still lists the file, Snowflake will attempt to read it from S3: if the file is truly gone, Snowflake’s behavior depends on the error — the docs say if Snowflake encounters an error scanning a file it may skip it and continue scanning other files (query might partially succeed). If the metadata has been refreshed and the file is unregistered, Snowflake will not attempt to read that file — it will read only the remaining registered files. ([Snowflake Documentation][1])\n",
    "\n",
    "**Practical flow when you see stale rows after a deletion:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Check if result cache was used (`USE_CACHED_RESULT` or repeat the query with `ALTER SESSION SET USE_CACHED_RESULT = FALSE;`). If cached, run with caching disabled to force real read. ([Snowflake Documentation][7])\n",
    "2. Run `SELECT * FROM TABLE(information_schema.external_table_files(TABLE_NAME=>'MY_EXT_TABLE'));` to see registered files and `EXTERNAL_TABLE_FILE_REGISTRATION_HISTORY` to see if an UNREGISTERED event exists. ([Snowflake Documentation][3])\n",
    "3. If metadata still lists the file, `ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE my_ext_table REFRESH;` to sync metadata. ([Snowflake Documentation][2])\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **How does Snowflake know which files belong to an external table?**\n",
    "   Snowflake stores file-level metadata in the external table metadata (names, etag/md5, last modified, registered\\_on). This is updated by `ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE ... REFRESH` or by AUTO\\_REFRESH via cloud events. ([Snowflake Documentation][3])\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **What happens if you delete or overwrite a file in S3 that an external table references?**\n",
    "   Metadata must be refreshed to reflect deletion/overwrite. Registration history will show `UNREGISTERED` or `REGISTERED_UPDATE`. Until refresh, Snowflake may still try to read the old file (and caches may hide the deletion). ([Snowflake Documentation][4])\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Explain Snowflake’s caching layers and how they affect external tables.**\n",
    "   There are (1) result cache (cloud, returns whole query results), (2) metadata cache (cloud services layer), and (3) warehouse local cache (compute local SSD). These can cause queries to return “stale” data if metadata and caches are not synced/cleared. ([Snowflake Documentation][7], [Snowflake Community][8])\n",

    "5. **How to safely replace a file used by an external table without producing inconsistent reads?**\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. What is an External Table in Snowflake? Why is it used?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* An external table is a schema object that references data stored in external stages (e.g., S3, Azure Blob, GCS).\n",
    "* It lets you **query semi-structured or structured files without loading them into Snowflake tables.**\n",
    "* **Use cases:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Data lake architecture (query data “in place”).\n",
    "  * Quick exploration of raw data.\n",
    "  * Avoid unnecessary storage costs when data doesn’t need to be in Snowflake permanently.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Why do we need to refresh metadata for external tables?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Snowflake doesn’t **automatically track new/removed/updated files** in S3.\n",
    "* When files are added, removed, or updated → the **external table’s metadata registry** is stale.\n",
    "* Refresh ensures Snowflake knows about file states (REGISTERED, UNREGISTERED, REGISTERED\\_UPDATE).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Command:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER EXTERNAL TABLE my_ext_table REFRESH;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. What happens if you delete a file from S3 but don’t refresh the external table?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* The **registry still shows the file**.\n",
    "* If queried soon after deletion, Snowflake may still **return data from the cloud services cache layer** (Snowflake’s internal cache).\n",
    "* Eventually, if refresh is done, the file becomes **UNREGISTERED** in the metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Explain caching behavior with external tables.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Case 1: File deleted, but query runs before metadata refresh**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Snowflake may serve data from the **cache layer** (query still works temporarily).\n",
    "* **Case 2: File deleted, after metadata refresh**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * File shows as **UNREGISTERED**, and queries will only read from remaining files in S3.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. What happens if you update a file in S3?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Snowflake does not auto-detect updates.\n",
    "* On refresh, the file status changes to **REGISTERED\\_UPDATE**.\n",
    "* File’s hash value changes → Snowflake recognizes new content.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. Why do we need partitions in external tables?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Imagine **10M log files across years** stored in S3.\n",
    "* Querying all files every time is expensive and slow.\n",
    "* **Partitioning** (by date, region, etc.) helps Snowflake **prune irrelevant files** and only scan what’s needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE logs_ext\n",
    "  ( event_time TIMESTAMP, log_data VARIANT )\n",
    "  PARTITION BY (to_date(split_part(metadata$filename, '/', 2)))\n",
    "  LOCATION = @my_stage/logs;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7. Is partitioning only for file filtering?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Mostly yes, but also for **performance scaling**.\n",
    "* By partitioning, queries only touch **a subset of files**, saving costs and improving performance.\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Querying all logs from `2025-09-06` doesn’t need to scan logs from 2024.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normally partitions are derived from file paths.\n",
    "* But in some cases, you need **user-specified partitions** (e.g., multiple datasets in the same folder).\n",

    "### **11. Why can’t you refresh a manually partitioned external table?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
