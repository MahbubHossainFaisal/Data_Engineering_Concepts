    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 What is Cloning in Snowflake?\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you’re working in a big data engineering team at IQVIA (your company 😉).\n",
    "You have a table called `PATIENT_FACT` which is 500 GB large. Now, you need to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Create a **sandbox version** of it for testing some transformations.\n",
    "* Or you want to **backup** the table before applying risky ETL logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "You could simply do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE PATIENT_FACT_BACKUP AS SELECT * FROM PATIENT_FACT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But that’s a *bad idea* ❌ because it physically copies 500 GB of data — doubling storage and time.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, Snowflake gives you **Zero-Copy Cloning**, which means:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You can create a copy of any object (table, schema, or database) **instantly** without physically copying any data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ How Cloning Works Internally (The Underlying Magic)\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s visualize how Snowflake stores data.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Snowflake stores all data as **immutable micro-partitions** in **cloud storage (S3 / Azure Blob / GCS)**.\n",
    "* When you create a table, Snowflake stores **metadata** (column names, structure, micro-partition IDs).\n",
    "* Each table’s “view” of the data is managed by metadata in the **Cloud Services Layer**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when you do this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE PATIENT_FACT_CLONE CLONE PATIENT_FACT;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake does **not** copy any data.\n",
    "✅ It just **copies the metadata** that points to the *same micro-partitions* of the original table.\n",
    "\n",
    "So both tables look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Table Name         | Metadata Points To          | Data Copied? |\n",
    "| ------------------ | --------------------------- | ------------ |\n",
    "| PATIENT_FACT       | micro-partitions A1, A2, A3 | ❌            |\n",
    "| PATIENT_FACT_CLONE | micro-partitions A1, A2, A3 | ❌            |\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s why cloning is **instant and cost-efficient**.\n",

    "### ⚡ What Happens After Cloning (Independence Explained)\n",
    "\n",
    "Now comes the key part of your question:\n",
    "\n",
    "> When we say cloning a table, that means cloning the metadata of that table.\n",
    "> But after cloning, both tables are independent. Explain this.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beautiful question, Mahbub 👏\n",
    "\n",
    "Yes, at the moment of cloning — both tables share the same data blocks.\n",
    "But as soon as **either table changes**, Snowflake uses something called **Copy-on-Write (CoW)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧠 Copy-on-Write Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create original table\n",
    "CREATE OR REPLACE TABLE SALES AS\n",
    "SELECT 1 AS ID, 'A' AS PRODUCT UNION ALL\n",

    "CREATE TABLE SALES_CLONE CLONE SALES;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "At this point:\n",
    "Both tables point to the same micro-partitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now if you do:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM SALES WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake will not modify the shared data. Instead, it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Creates a *new micro-partition* for `SALES` excluding that row.\n",
    "* Keeps the old one for `SALES_CLONE`.\n",

    "| SALES_CLONE | A1 (old, contains ID=1,2)    | ID=1,2       |\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ The two are now **independent**, but the cloning was still **zero-copy** initially.\n",

    "\n",
    "### **1️⃣ What is zero-copy cloning in Snowflake and how does it differ from CTAS (Create Table As Select)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "Zero-copy cloning allows you to create a copy of a table, schema, or database *instantly* without physically copying any data.\n",
    "When you clone, Snowflake just copies the **metadata** that points to the existing **micro-partitions** — not the actual data files.\n",
    "\n",
    "CTAS (Create Table As Select), on the other hand, physically writes a new set of data to storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "| Operation | Data Movement      | Time                   | Cost     |\n",
    "| --------- | ------------------ | ---------------------- | -------- |\n",
    "| CLONE     | No (metadata only) | Instant                | Very low |\n",
    "| CTAS      | Yes (copies data)  | Slow (depends on size) | High     |\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE EMP_CLONE CLONE EMP;  -- Instant clone\n",
    "CREATE TABLE EMP_COPY AS SELECT * FROM EMP;  -- Physical copy\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "So, cloning = “reference same data blocks,”\n",
    "CTAS = “make a new data set.”\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ What happens when the source table is modified after cloning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "When the source table or the clone is modified, Snowflake uses **Copy-on-Write**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s the logic:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Initially, both the original and the clone point to the same data blocks.\n",
    "* When a change (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) happens, Snowflake *does not* modify shared blocks.\n",
    "* Instead, it writes *new* micro-partitions for the modified table, keeping the other unaffected.\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "DELETE FROM SALES WHERE ID = 1;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "→ Only `SALES` gets new micro-partitions excluding that record.\n",
    "→ `SALES_CLONE` still has the old data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, after the first change, both become **independent**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3️⃣ What happens when you drop the source table after cloning?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "If you drop the source table, the clone remains **intact** and fully functional.\n",
    "The clone has its own metadata reference, even if it still points to some of the same micro-partitions in storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snowflake handles reference counting internally — meaning:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Micro-partitions are only physically deleted when **no object** (source or clone) references them.\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE T1 AS SELECT * FROM VALUES (1),(2);\n",
    "CREATE TABLE T2 CLONE T1;\n",
    "DROP TABLE T1;  -- Clone T2 remains unaffected\n",
    "SELECT * FROM T2;  -- Works fine\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4️⃣ Can cloning be done across databases or schemas?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "Yes! You can clone across schemas or even databases **within the same Snowflake account**.\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TABLE SALES_DB.RAW.SALES_CLONE CLONE PROD_DB.PUBLIC.SALES;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, **cross-account cloning** is **not supported directly**.\n",
    "You’d need to use **database replication** or **data sharing** for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5️⃣ Can we clone a table that has been deleted but still within the Time Travel period?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "Yes! That’s one of Snowflake’s coolest recovery tricks.\n",
    "If a table was dropped, you can still clone it *within its Time Travel retention period.*\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Suppose SALES table was dropped\n",
    "CREATE TABLE SALES_RESTORE CLONE SALES AT (BEFORE (TIMESTAMP => '2025-10-18 10:00:00'));\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even though `SALES` was dropped, Snowflake still keeps its metadata and micro-partitions under Time Travel.\n",
    "Cloning from that allows you to **recover deleted data instantly** — no restore needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6️⃣ Can we clone views, materialized views, or sequences?**\n",

    "* You **can** clone:\n",
    "\n",

    "### **7️⃣ Does cloning also copy access privileges?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "No. When you clone, **privileges are not inherited** from the source object.\n",
    "\n",
    "You must explicitly grant privileges again:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "GRANT SELECT ON TABLE EMP_CLONE TO ROLE ANALYST;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "However, cloning a **schema or database** can include grants if you specify the `INCLUDE ALL` parameter.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8️⃣ What happens if you clone a transient or temporary table?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* You **can clone a transient table**, and the clone will also be transient.\n",
    "* But you **cannot clone a temporary table** — temporary tables are session-scoped.\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE T1 AS SELECT * FROM VALUES (1);\n",
    "CREATE TRANSIENT TABLE T2 CLONE T1;  -- ✅ Works\n",
    "CREATE TEMP TABLE T3 AS SELECT * FROM VALUES (1);\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1️⃣ What happens when two tables have different structures during a swap?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "Snowflake will **not allow the swap**.\n",
    "Both tables must have **identical structure** — same column names, same order, same data types, and constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE T1 SWAP WITH T2;\n",
    "-- ❌ Error if T1(ID INT, NAME STRING) and T2(ID INT, NAME VARCHAR(100), AGE INT)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Even a single column mismatch will cause failure.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2️⃣ Does swap move data physically or just metadata?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "Swap only changes **metadata references**.\n",
    "It’s a **zero-copy operation**, meaning it does *not* move or rewrite data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Internally:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The tables’ metadata pointers to micro-partitions are swapped.\n",
    "* Data stays in place.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, it’s **instant**, **atomic**, and **cost-free** (besides minimal metadata changes).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3️⃣ Can you swap tables across schemas?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "No.\n",
    "You can only swap tables **within the same schema**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you need to swap across schemas, you’d have to move or recreate one table into the target schema first.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4️⃣ After a swap, which table retains privileges, constraints, and ownership?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "The **original table name** retains its privileges, constraints, and ownership.\n",
    "That’s one of the main reasons to use swap — you keep all grants intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- SALES has GRANT SELECT to ANALYST\n",
    "ALTER TABLE SALES SWAP WITH SALES_NEW;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "After swap:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `SALES` still has the `SELECT` grant for `ANALYST`.\n",
    "* Data in `SALES` is now the *new* data from `SALES_NEW`.\n",
    "\n",
    "So you refresh data **without breaking permissions** or dependent objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5️⃣ What are common use cases of table swap in a data pipeline?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "**Use Case 1: Zero-Downtime Data Refresh**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Build new data in a staging table.\n",
    "* Validate it.\n",
    "* Swap with live table instantly.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE SALES SWAP WITH SALES_STAGE;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case 2: Instant Rollback**\n",
    "\n",
    "* If new data causes issues, swap again to revert.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use Case 3: Continuous Integration Deployment**\n",
    "\n",
    "* When you rebuild tables as part of CI/CD, swap avoids downtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6️⃣ What happens if a table has a stream or task attached — can you swap it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "You **cannot** swap a table that has **active streams** or **tasks** referencing it.\n",
    "You must drop or suspend them first.\n",
    "This ensures data tracking consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **7️⃣ Can table swap be undone?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "Not directly — but since the swap operation swaps both tables’ data,\n",
    "you can **swap again** to revert to the old state.\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "ALTER TABLE SALES SWAP WITH SALES_NEW;  -- Refresh data\n",
    "ALTER TABLE SALES SWAP WITH SALES_NEW;  -- Rollback\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Each swap is reversible as long as both tables remain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **8️⃣ What happens to Time Travel and Fail-safe data after swap?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Answer:**\n",
    "Both tables retain their **own historical data versions**.\n",
    "Snowflake only swaps **current metadata pointers**, not their Time Travel history.\n",
    "\n",
    "That means if you query Time Travel on `SALES`, you’ll still see its own historical versions from before the swap.\n",
