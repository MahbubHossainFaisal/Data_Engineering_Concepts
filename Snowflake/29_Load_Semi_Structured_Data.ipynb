    "\n",
    "Let‚Äôs start with a story.\n",
    "\n",
    "You‚Äôre a **Data Engineer at a global ride-sharing company** like Uber or Bolt.\n",
    "Every second, thousands of rides are being created by mobile apps. The app sends data in **JSON format** because it‚Äôs flexible ‚Äî the same ride event might contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The driver‚Äôs info,\n",
    "* The customer‚Äôs info,\n",
    "* An array of pickup and drop-off coordinates,\n",
    "* Nested structures for payment details, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, here‚Äôs the problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You can‚Äôt design a fixed table schema because every event might have *slightly different fields* (due to app version, location, or feature changes).\n",
    "* You still need to **query this data**, **analyze it**, and **join it** with structured data like driver or customer tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly why Snowflake shines ‚Äî because it can **natively store and query semi-structured data** like JSON, Parquet, ORC, XML, and Avro, using the **VARIANT** data type.\n",

    "* Avro\n",
    "* Parquet\n",
    "* ORC\n",
    "* XML\n",

    "The **VARIANT** data type allows Snowflake to store **semi-structured data** such as JSON, Avro, Parquet, ORC, or XML in a **single column** without requiring a predefined schema.\n",

    "\n",
    "Without `FLATTEN`, if a column contains an array (e.g., list of cities), you can‚Äôt easily analyze each item. `FLATTEN` turns that array into a **set of rows**, which makes aggregation, filtering, and joins possible.\n",
