    "\n",
    "When a clustering key is defined on a table, Snowflake **periodically reorganizes** the micro-partitions in the background so that similar values of those columns are stored **closer together**. This improves **partition pruning**, which reduces the number of micro-partitions scanned during query execution.\n",
