    "\n",
    "Embeddings are **numerical representations** of text (words, sentences, paragraphs, documents) in **high-dimensional vector space**. These vectors capture the **semantic meaning** of text, allowing us to compare, cluster, and retrieve them based on **meaning**, not just keywords.\n",

    "## ✅ **Beginner-Level Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **1. What is an embedding?**\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Answer**:\n",
    "An **embedding** is a numerical vector that represents text in a high-dimensional space such that **semantically similar texts are closer together** in that space.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* \"Dog\" and \"Puppy\" will have vectors that are closer together than \"Dog\" and \"Car\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Embeddings capture **semantic meaning**, unlike one-hot encodings or bag-of-words.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Why can't we use keyword search in Gen AI pipelines?**\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Answer**:\n",
    "**Keyword search**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Matches exact terms.\n",
    "* Fails when synonyms or paraphrasing is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "\"How to eat mango?\" vs \"Ways to consume mango\"\n",
    "→ Keyword search = no match\n",
    "→ Embedding search = semantic match (both mean the same)\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, in Gen AI pipelines, embeddings are used to retrieve **relevant context** even if the exact words differ.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. What is chunking and why is it necessary before embedding?**\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Answer**:\n",
    "**Chunking** means splitting a large document into smaller parts (e.g., 500 words/chars per chunk).\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Why necessary?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLMs (and embedding models) have **token limits** (e.g., OpenAI may support up to 8192 tokens).\n",
    "* Smaller chunks help maintain **coherent meaning** in each vector.\n",
    "* Enables **faster search and better context injection** during RAG.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chunking ensures **context is preserved and searchable** within token constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ✅ **Intermediate-Level Questions**\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. How does RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter work?**\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Answer**:\n",
    "`RecursiveCharacterTextSplitter` is a smart splitting algorithm used in LangChain.\n",
    "\n",
    "It tries to split text **in a hierarchical order**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "1. Paragraphs (on \"\\n\\n\")\n",
    "2. Sentences (on \". \")\n",
    "3. Words\n",
    "4. Characters (if nothing else works)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "It ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Chunks are of **uniform length** (e.g., 500 tokens).\n",
    "* **Overlap** is maintained (e.g., 50 tokens) to preserve continuity across chunks.\n",
    "\n",
    "📘 **Benefit**: Balances between splitting at natural boundaries and staying within token size.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Why is cosine similarity preferred in vector search?**\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Answer**:\n",
    "**Cosine similarity** measures the **angle** between vectors, not their magnitude.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why it's good**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Captures **directional similarity** (i.e., semantic closeness).\n",
    "* Unaffected by **vector length** (which can vary due to phrasing or word count).\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `\"I love AI\"` and `\"AI is great\"` → similar direction (semantic), different length → high cosine similarity.\n",

    "### **7. What challenges would you face while using a vector DB at scale (millions of embeddings)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 **Answer**:\n",
    "Common challenges:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Indexing Time**: Building ANN (approximate nearest neighbor) indexes becomes slow.\n",
    "2. **Memory Usage**: High-dimensional vectors consume lots of RAM/disk.\n",
    "3. **Latency**: Real-time similarity search needs vector indexes like HNSW, IVF.\n",
    "4. **Data Drift**: Over time, meanings shift → re-embedding becomes necessary.\n",
    "5. **Updating Vectors**: Updating embeddings is not atomic in some DBs.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Best Practice**:\n",
    "\n",

    "* **Save space**\n",
    "* **Improve speed** without much semantic loss\n",
