    "## 🔍 What is a \"Run Type\" in LangSmith?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **run** in LangSmith represents a **step** in the execution of your GenAI application — this could be calling an LLM, retrieving documents, parsing a response, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "LangSmith classifies each of these runs by **type** to help:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Visualize trace trees meaningfully\n",
    "* Debug parts more easily\n",
    "* Group similar runs for performance/cost analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 🧩 1. **LLM Run**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 **What it is**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A run that represents a **Large Language Model** (LLM) call — like OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Use Case**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Every time you **call an LLM to generate** output (e.g., summary, response, SQL generation), LangSmith creates an **LLM-type run**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **How it looks in LangSmith**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clearly labeled as `LLM`\n",
    "* Shows input messages or prompts\n",
    "* Shows temperature, model name, tokens, latency\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📍 **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI\n",
    "\n",
    "llm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4\")\n",
    "llm.predict(\"Summarize the following article...\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This creates a **LLM Run** in the trace tree under your main Chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## 📚 2. **Retriever Run**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 **What it is**:\n",
    "\n",
    "This represents a **retrieval call** to fetch documents from a vector database or search index (like FAISS, Pinecone, Weaviate, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Use Case**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**, this run tells you what docs were fetched and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **How LangSmith handles it**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shows query passed\n",
    "* Shows the list of retrieved documents\n",
    "* Time taken to retrieve\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📍 **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.vectorstores import FAISS\n",
    "\n",
    "retriever = faiss.as_retriever()\n",

    "## 🛠️ 3. **Tool Run**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 **What it is**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Tool Run** occurs when an **Agent calls a tool** during decision-making.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Use Case**:\n",
    "\n",
    "When using LangChain’s Agent architecture, the agent often decides to call tools like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Calculator\n",
    "* Search\n",
    "* Weather\n",
    "* Custom API tools\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **How LangSmith visualizes it**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shows **input to tool**\n",
    "* Shows **output from tool**\n",
    "* Captures **tool name**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📍 **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool\n",
    "\n",
    "tools = [Tool(name=\"Calculator\", func=my_calc_func, description=\"...\")]\n",
    "agent = initialize_agent(tools=tools, llm=llm, agent_type=\"zero-shot-react-description\")\n",
    "\n",
    "agent.run(\"What is 5 * 11?\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You’ll see:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Tool Run` for `Calculator`\n",
    "* Input: `\"5 * 11\"`\n",
    "* Output: `\"55\"`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ⛓️ 4. **Chain Run** (Default Type)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 **What it is**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Any **LangChain chain or function** you decorate with `@traceable` becomes a **Chain run** by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Use Case**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You write a function that glues other parts: retrieval + LLM + formatting → that's a chain.\n",
    "* This is often the **root** of your trace.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **Why Important**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains are the **structural units** in your trace tree — they often contain:\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLM Runs\n",
    "* Retriever Runs\n",
    "* Prompt Runs\n",
    "* Tool Runs\n",
    "\n",

    "```python\n",
    "from langsmith.traceable import traceable\n",

    "\n",
    "## 📝 5. **Prompt Run**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 **What it is**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Prompt Run** represents the stage where a **prompt template is being filled or formatted** before being sent to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Use Case**:\n",
    "\n",
    "You might have complex templates with variables. If something goes wrong, prompt run helps debug it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **What it captures**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Template structure\n",
    "* Final filled prompt\n",
    "* Variables used\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📍 **Example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain.prompts import PromptTemplate\n",
    "\n",
    "prompt = PromptTemplate.from_template(\"Answer based on: {context}\\nQuestion: {question}\")\n",

    "## 🔄 6. **Parser Run**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📘 **What it is**:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you **parse** the raw output from an LLM (JSON, text, SQL), LangSmith can log it as a **Parser Run**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **Use Case**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLM outputs structured data\n",
    "* You extract key fields\n",
    "* If parsing fails, LangSmith shows it clearly\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 **Typical scenario**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Parsing with `StructuredOutputParser`\n",
    "* Custom parsing logic\n",

    "from langchain.output_parsers import StructuredOutputParser\n",
    "\n",
    "parser = StructuredOutputParser.from_response_schema(schema)\n",

    "LangSmith categorizes these run types so developers can isolate and debug individual stages in a multi-step GenAI pipeline.\n",

    "### ✅ **2. What run type does `@traceable` default to, and how can you customize it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "* By default, `@traceable` logs a run as type **`chain`**.\n",
    "* This makes sense because a decorated function usually wraps a *pipeline* or composite step.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🛠️ Customize it like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@traceable(name=\"parse_tool_output\", run_type=\"parser\")\n",
    "def parse_output(output):\n",
    "    ...\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "✔️ This flexibility allows you to **accurately represent the function’s intent** in your trace tree, improving readability and debugging.\n",

    "\n",
    "### ✅ **3. How do nested run types help you debug a complex agent?**\n",
    "\n",
    "When using LangSmith, **nested runs** give you a **call hierarchy**.\n",

    "With nesting:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You **see the tool calls** and their responses.\n",
    "* You **see which LLM calls** are being made at which steps.\n",
    "* You **track latency per component**.\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ This helps isolate bugs like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Tool call failed? Go to Tool Run.\n",
    "* Response format broke? Go to Parser Run.\n",
    "* Wrong reasoning? Go to LLM Run.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### ✅ **4. If your RAG pipeline is not returning documents, which run type should you inspect?**\n",
    "\n",
    "👉 You should **inspect the `Retriever` run**.\n",

    "This will show:\n",

    "* What documents were returned (if any)\n",
    "* If there was a timeout or API error\n",

    "\n",
    "You’d inspect the **Prompt Run**.\n",
