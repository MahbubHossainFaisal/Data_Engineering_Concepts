    "## ✅ 1. **Why is evaluation necessary for LLM apps?**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✳️ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are **non-deterministic** — the same input may return different outputs across runs. Without proper evaluation:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You cannot **reliably measure performance**.\n",
    "* You won't catch **regressions**.\n",

    "## ✅ 4. **Why separate retriever and generator datasets in RAG applications?**\n",

    "\n",
    "* `Retriever Dataset`: Input is `query`, output is `retrieved_docs`\n",

    "### ✳️ Answer:\n",
    "\n",
    "Input/output schemas define **structure and field types** for your examples. It helps:\n",

    "* Prevent malformed inputs (e.g., missing keys)\n",

    "* **Prioritize** examples (`critical`, `edge`, `simple`)\n",

    "Tag 10 examples as `\"edge-case\"` and run evaluation **only on them** before deploying a new model.\n",
