    "\n",
    "**Groq** is a **hardware and software platform** built to deliver **ultra-low latency AI inference**, especially for LLMs and Gen AI workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of Groq as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A **competitor to NVIDIA GPUs and Google TPUs**, but optimized for deterministic inference latency.\n",

    "### 🔹 What Problem Does Groq Solve?\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "Groq solves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* ⏱️ **Sub-10ms latency** per token.\n",
    "* ✅ **Deterministic output**: You get a predictable, real-time response.\n",

    "In Gen AI:\n",
    "\n",
    "* You pass a **prompt** to an LLM (like GPT, Mistral, or LLaMA).\n",

    "\n",
    "1. **Deterministic Single-core Execution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Unlike GPUs (which batch jobs), LPU runs everything **on a single core** with no context-switching.\n",
    "   * That means **no queue delays**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Pipelined Execution:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Each token generation is pipelined like an assembly line, keeping throughput high.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Streaming-first Architecture:**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * Designed for **real-time streaming** of tokens instead of waiting for batch generation.\n",
    "   * Reduces latency for use-cases like chatbots, agents, or autonomous control.\n",

    "### 🔹 What is `langchain_core`?\n",
    "\n",
    "* `langchain_core` is a **minimal, foundational** package of LangChain.\n",
    "* It includes all the **LCEL interfaces, prompt/message definitions, and base classes** like `Runnable`, `ChatMessage`, etc.\n",
    "* It is intentionally kept **lean** to be **LLM-provider agnostic** and to support minimal dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Use `langchain_core` when you're building low-level chains or embedding LCEL into custom apps without bloated dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 `system_message` vs `human_message`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ What are they?\n",
    "\n",
    "* `system_message`: Sets behavior, tone, and instruction context for the model.\n",
    "* `human_message`: Actual input or query from the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **You cannot combine them into one message** because modern chat-based LLMs (like OpenAI, Anthropic) **expect separate roles** for proper context handling.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🤔 Why not a single prompt?\n",
    "\n",
    "Because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The model treats **system** and **human** differently during token attention.\n",
    "* System message is **not scored** for response generation—it guides behavior.\n",
    "* If you merge them, the model won’t **differentiate between instruction vs question**, leading to unpredictable outputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 Difference between using `SystemMessage` & `HumanMessage` separately vs in `from_messages()`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🧪 Separate Construction (Manual):\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from langchain_core.messages import SystemMessage, HumanMessage\n",
    "\n",
    "messages = [\n",
    "    SystemMessage(content=\"You are a helpful assistant.\"),\n",
    "    HumanMessage(content=\"What is LCEL?\")\n",
    "]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### ✅ Using `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages()`:\n",
    "\n",

    "    (\"human\", \"What is LCEL?\")\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage of `from_messages()`**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Clean, declarative.\n",
    "* Composable and chainable.\n",
    "* Easier to manage long multi-turn dialogues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 What does `from_messages()` do?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Converts a list of message roles and strings into a `ChatPromptTemplate`.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([\n",

    "  (\"human\", \"Who is Alan Turing?\")\n",
    "])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔸 What does `to_messages()` do?\n",
    "\n",
    "* Converts a prompt with variables to **runtime-ready `ChatMessages`**, filling in dynamic values.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "prompt.to_messages({\"name\": \"Alan Turing\"})\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔗 What is the Need for Chains?\n",
    "\n",
    "Chains allow you to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Break down your pipeline into **modular blocks**.\n",
    "* Compose:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * Prompt → Model → Output Parser\n",
    "  * Prompt → Model → Tool → Follow-up Prompt\n",
    "* Add logic, memory, retrieval, tools in steps.\n",

    "### 🔸 Why chains make life easier (With Example):\n",
    "\n",
    "Without chains:\n",

    "# Manually do all steps\n",
    "prompt = \"Translate {text} to French\"\n",
