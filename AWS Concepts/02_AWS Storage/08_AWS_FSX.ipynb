    "Here's a complete use case scenario for **Amazon FSx**:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scenario: Media Production Company with High-Performance Needs\n",
    "\n",
    "A media production company works on large-scale video editing projects, often dealing with terabytes of data that need to be shared across teams of editors, animators, and post-production specialists. The company’s existing storage infrastructure struggles to handle the heavy workloads and high throughput demands of video rendering and editing. The team also needs efficient collaboration, with file version control and shared access across different locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution: Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance Requirements:**  \n",
    "   The company selects **Amazon FSx for NetApp ONTAP**, known for its ability to handle large file storage with high throughput. This solution supports multiple editors working simultaneously on high-definition (HD) or 4K video files without performance bottlenecks.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Data Management Needs:**  \n",
    "   With NetApp ONTAP, the team can leverage advanced data management features like **snapshots** and **clones** to create versions of files or projects without duplicating storage. This saves storage space and enhances collaboration by providing a seamless way to track versions and rollback to previous states if needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Multi-Site Collaboration:**  \n",
    "   The team operates across different geographic regions, but with **FSx for NetApp ONTAP’s multi-protocol support** (NFS, SMB), team members can access the same file systems from Windows or Linux-based editing stations without needing to convert formats or reconfigure environments. SnapMirror can replicate data between locations efficiently for disaster recovery or improved collaboration.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Scalability and Cost Management:**  \n",
    "   As the company scales its projects, FSx’s **elastic scalability** allows them to increase capacity or performance without downtime. They can also reduce costs using **automatic tiering**, storing cold or less frequently accessed data in a cheaper tier while keeping hot data (like current video projects) in high-performance storage.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why FSx was Chosen:\n",
    "- **Performance:** Provides low-latency, high-throughput file access needed for HD/4K video editing.\n",
    "- **Data Management Features:** Snapshot and cloning help manage large, shared datasets.\n",
    "- **Multi-Protocol Support:** Facilitates cross-platform collaboration (Windows and Linux).\n",
    "- **Seamless Integration:** Supports hybrid environments, enabling easy access from AWS cloud and on-premises environments.\n",
    "  \n",
    "This setup improves the team's productivity by reducing file access delays, simplifying collaboration, and cutting costs on storage as the media company expands its projects."
