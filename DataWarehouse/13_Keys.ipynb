    "## ðŸ”‘ **1. Primary Key**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Primary Key** is a column (or a combination of columns) in a table that **uniquely identifies each row**. It **cannot be NULL** and must be **unique** for each row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Must be **unique** across the table\n",
    "* **Cannot contain NULLs**\n",
    "* Enforces **entity integrity**\n",
    "* Usually **indexed** for performance\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "To ensure **data integrity** by uniquely identifying each record.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Real-world example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a `customer_dim` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "customer_id (PK) | customer_name | email       | phone\n",
    "-----------------|---------------|-------------|--------\n",
    "101              | Alice         | a@x.com      | 123456\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `customer_id` is the **primary key**. It uniquely identifies each customer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Interview tip**:\n",
    "\n",
    "> A dimension or fact table **must** have a primary key to uniquely identify each record. In data warehouses, we often use **surrogate keys** as primary keys for dimension tables.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”‘ **2. Foreign Key**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Foreign Key** is a column (or columns) that **refer to the primary key** of another table, creating a **relationship** between the two.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Maintains **referential integrity**\n",
    "* Can contain **NULLs** (if the relationship is optional)\n",
    "* Usually used to link **Fact â†” Dimension**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "To **connect tables** and define **relationships** (especially star/snowflake schema).\n",

    "## ðŸ”‘ **3. Composite Key**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Composite Key** is a **primary key** made of **two or more columns** that together uniquely identify a row.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each individual column **may not be unique**\n",
    "* Only the **combination** is unique\n",
    "* Used when no single column is sufficient to act as a PK\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "To define uniqueness where **no single attribute** can do it alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Real-world example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In a `student_enrollment` table:\n",
    "\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Composite Primary Key: (`student_id`, `course_id`)\n",
    "\n",
    "This ensures that a student can enroll **only once per course**, but the same `student_id` or `course_id` can repeat.\n",

    "## ðŸ”‘ **4. Natural Key (a.k.a. Business Key)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Natural Key** is an attribute that **already exists in the real world** and can uniquely identify a record â€” like Social Security Number, Email, or ISBN.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Comes from **business data**\n",
    "* Often meaningful to humans\n",
    "* Can be used as PK **but comes with risks**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid using artificial identifiers, and to stay **aligned with business logic**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Real-world example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In `employee_dim`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "employee_ssn (Natural PK) | name     | department\n",
    "--------------------------|----------|-----------\n",
    "AAA1111                  | Bob      | HR\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, `employee_ssn` could be used as a **natural key**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **When natural key breaks**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* If the business rule changes (e.g., a company starts issuing new SSNs or changes product codes).\n",
    "* If duplicates or NULLs sneak in over time due to dirty data\n",
    "* If it's subject to change (email address, phone number, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hence**, we usually prefer a **surrogate key** in data warehouses.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸ”‘ **5. Surrogate Key (a.k.a. Factless Key)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Definition**:\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Surrogate Key** is a **system-generated, meaningless** identifier (usually a number) used as a **primary key** in dimension tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Features**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Not derived from business data\n",
    "* Not exposed to end-users\n",
    "* Unaffected by changes in business rules\n",
    "* Enables easy joins with fact tables\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Purpose**:\n",
    "\n",
    "To provide a **stable, consistent** identifier, especially important for **SCD Type 2** and other history tracking.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **Real-world example**:\n",
    "\n",
    "In `product_dim`:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "product_sk (PK) | product_code | product_name\n",
    "---------------|--------------|--------------\n",
    "1001           | P-201        | Chair\n",
    "1002           | P-201        | Chair (updated)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Both rows have the same `product_code` but different surrogate keys â€” **crucial** for tracking **changes** over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹ **In SCD Type 2**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Each version of a record gets a **new surrogate key** so that we can differentiate them in the **fact table joins**.\n",

    "### **1. Why do we prefer surrogate keys over natural keys in dimension tables?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "We prefer **surrogate keys** because:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Stability**: Natural keys can change (e.g., product codes or employee IDs), which breaks referential integrity. Surrogate keys are immutable.\n",
    "* **Simplified joins**: Surrogate keys are integers, making joins faster and more efficient compared to large string-based natural keys.\n",
    "* **SCD Type 2 support**: To track historical versions of a record, each version needs a unique identifier. Natural keys wonâ€™t allow that.\n",
    "* **Avoid data issues**: Natural keys might not be truly unique due to data quality issues in source systems. Surrogate keys avoid this.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ **Example**: In `product_dim`, if product codes change over time, using them as PK breaks relationships. Surrogate keys maintain consistency.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **2. Can a surrogate key be used in a fact table?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "Yes, in fact, **fact tables almost always use surrogate keys** to link to dimension tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each foreign key in the fact table points to the **surrogate key** (PK) in a dimension table.\n",
    "* This ensures **consistency**, supports **slowly changing dimensions**, and keeps the **data model performant**.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ **Example**:\n",
    "In a `sales_fact` table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "sale_id | customer_sk | product_sk | sales_amount\n",
    "--------|-------------|------------|--------------\n",
    "1       | 1001        | 2005       | 350.00\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "`customer_sk` and `product_sk` are surrogate keys from `customer_dim` and `product_dim`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **3. Give an example where a natural key failed and needed to be replaced.**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "Letâ€™s say a company used **email addresses** as natural keys for customers. But:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A customer **changes their email** or creates a new one.\n",
    "* Two customers **share** the same email temporarily (mistake or shared mailbox).\n",
    "* One record gets created with a **typo** in the email.\n",
    "\n",
    "This breaks the uniqueness of the natural key and causes **data integrity issues**. To solve this, a **surrogate key** is introduced as a stable, system-generated identifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **4. Whatâ€™s the risk of using composite keys in large fact tables?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "Composite keys in fact tables can cause:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Performance issues**: Joins become slower as multiple columns are involved in joins and indexes.\n",
    "* **Complexity**: More complex ETL logic and maintenance overhead.\n",
    "* **Storage overhead**: Larger indexes due to multi-column combinations.\n",
    "* **Error-prone**: Higher chance of mistakes in ETL and downstream reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Hence, we **avoid composite keys** in fact tables and rely on **surrogate keys** to simplify the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **5. Can a foreign key be part of a primary key?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "Yes, this is commonly seen in **bridge tables** or **association tables**.\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ‘‰ **Example**:\n",
    "In a `student_course` table where each student can enroll in multiple courses:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "1001           | MA101\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, (`student_id`, `course_id`) together form a **composite primary key**, and both are **foreign keys** referencing `student` and `course` tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **6. How do surrogate keys help with SCD Type 2 implementation?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "In **SCD Type 2**, every time a change occurs in a dimension record, we:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Insert a new row** with updated data\n",
    "* Keep the old record for history\n",
    "* Use a new **surrogate key** for the new version\n",
    "\n",
    "This means multiple rows can exist for the same business entity (natural key), and the fact table should point to the **correct version** of the dimension record.\n",
    "\n",
