    "### 🔁 1. **No Single Source of Truth (SSOT)**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 Problem:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data lives in silos: POS in Oracle, Website in MySQL, Finance in SAP, etc.\n",
    "* Different teams report **different numbers** for the same KPIs.\n",

    "#### 🔹 Problem:\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 🔍 Example:\n",
    "\n",

    "* Most transactional systems overwrite data.\n",
    "* You can’t track changes over time (e.g., price changes, customer moves cities).\n",
