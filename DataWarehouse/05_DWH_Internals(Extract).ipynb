    "\n",
    "The **staging layer acts as a safety net**. It stores raw, untransformed data from source systems before any business logic is applied.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí¨ *Example*: Suppose a nightly ETL job pulls sales data from an API. If the API changes its format, the transformation step may break. But if you have the data staged, you can inspect the raw input and fix the issue **without needing to re-pull** from source.\n",

    "* Ensures **data recovery and auditability**\n",

    "* Mix raw and business data\n",
    "* Lose **data quality**, **reusability**, and **governance**\n",

    "* Poor performance\n",

    "   * Join sales & customer profiles\n",
    "   * Clean phone numbers, deduplicate customers\n",
