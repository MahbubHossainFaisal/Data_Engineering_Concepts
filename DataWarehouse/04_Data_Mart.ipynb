    "1. **Not all users need all data**:\n",
    "\n",

    "   * Finance can protect salary data, for example.\n",

    "### ‚úÖ **1. What is a Data Mart, and how is it different from a Data Warehouse?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "A **Data Mart** is a **focused, subject-specific subset** of a Data Warehouse designed to serve the analytical needs of a specific business unit, like Sales, Finance, or HR. While a **Data Warehouse** stores **enterprise-wide data** integrated from multiple domains, a **Data Mart** tailors that data for **departmental consumption**, typically with more **summarization, security, and autonomy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**:\n",
    "If your Data Warehouse stores all transactional data for the organization, a Sales Data Mart might only contain data related to customer purchases, sales targets, regional performance, and product categories ‚Äî enabling the Sales team to query and visualize KPIs without waiting on the central team.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **2. Why would you create a Data Mart even if you already have a Data Warehouse?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "We create Data Marts **on top of an existing Data Warehouse** for three key reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Performance**: Smaller, more optimized datasets reduce query complexity and improve dashboard responsiveness.\n",
    "2. **Security and Governance**: Business units often deal with sensitive data (e.g., Finance). A Data Mart lets us enforce **fine-grained access controls**.\n",
    "3. **Departmental Autonomy**: Data Marts empower domain users to build their own reports without relying on central IT or risking disruption to the EDW.\n",
    "\n",
    "So even if the enterprise has a central warehouse, Data Marts **enhance agility, scalability, and governance** at the departmental level.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **3. What are the pros and cons of Independent vs. Dependent Data Marts?**\n",

    "**Answer**:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Type            | Pros                                                         | Cons                                                                   |\n",
    "| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",

    "| **Dependent**   | - High consistency<br>- Standard ETL<br>- Central governance | - Longer setup<br>- Requires coordination with DWH team                |\n",
    "\n",
    "**My take**: In an enterprise, **Dependent Data Marts are preferred** because they offer consistent data definitions across departments. However, **Independent Marts are useful** for quick prototypes or where central infrastructure is lacking.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **4. Why is ETL preferred over ELT in Data Marts?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "**ETL** is preferred in Data Marts because the data needs to be **clean, structured, and aggregated before it‚Äôs loaded**. Unlike a Data Lake or modern DWH where raw data can be transformed on demand (ELT), Data Marts are **designed for immediate analytical use** by business users ‚Äî so pre-transforming the data ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Faster queries**\n",
    "* **Better performance**\n",
    "* **Easier maintenance**\n",
    "* **Better control over metrics and dimensions**\n",
    "\n",
    "So while **ELT offers flexibility**, **ETL ensures usability**, which is crucial in business-facing Data Marts.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **5. Can you walk through a real-world scenario where you used a Data Mart?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "At my previous company, we had a large Snowflake Data Warehouse that integrated data from Salesforce, SAP, and web analytics tools. The Marketing team complained of **slow dashboards and unclear metrics**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We created a **Marketing Data Mart** containing:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Cleaned campaign data\n",
    "* Aggregated customer engagement metrics\n",
    "* Attribution logic\n",
    "* Pre-computed funnel stages\n",
    "\n",
    "Using **dbt for transformation** and **Airflow for orchestration**, we refreshed the Data Mart hourly. This reduced dashboard load time by 80% and allowed the marketing team to **self-serve** analytics using Looker. It also ensured that everyone used the **same definitions** for campaign ROI and customer journey stages.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **6. What performance optimization techniques are used in a Data Mart?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer**:\n",
    "Several strategies are used to ensure **fast, reliable performance** in a Data Mart:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Aggregation Tables**: Pre-calculate daily, weekly, monthly KPIs to reduce compute time.\n",
    "2. **Partitioning**: Use date-based partitioning to limit scanned data.\n",
    "3. **Materialized Views**: Create pre-computed views for common queries.\n",
    "4. **Dimensional Modeling**: Use star/snowflake schemas for optimized joins and readability.\n",
    "5. **Columnar Storage (e.g., in Snowflake/BigQuery)**: Leverages data skipping and compression.\n",
    "6. **Indexing or Clustering (where supported)**: For faster filtering and sorting.\n",
    "7. **Data Pruning**: Keep only the necessary data in the mart (e.g., last 2 years).\n",
