    "\n",
    "1. **What is a conformed dimension? Why is it useful in data warehousing?**\n",
    "   A conformed dimension is a dimension that is **shared across multiple fact tables or data marts** and has the **same meaning and structure**. It's useful because it ensures **data consistency** across the entire warehouse ‚Äî allowing reports from different business processes to be **joined and compared accurately**.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Can you give a real-world scenario where conformed dimensions are shared across fact tables?**\n",
    "   Example: A `Date` dimension used in both `Sales Fact` and `Inventory Fact`. Both tables can join on the same `Date_Key`, allowing unified time-based analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What challenges have you faced in maintaining conformed dimensions?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Versioning** across systems\n",
    "   * **Schema alignment** when different teams modify the dimension\n",
    "   * Ensuring **data type consistency** and **synchronized updates** across environments\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How do conformed dimensions help maintain consistency across reports?**\n",
    "   They act as a **single source of truth**. Since the same structure and values are reused, metrics from different business areas (like Sales and Finance) are **logically consistent** when aggregated or filtered.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **How do you use a role-playing dimension in SQL or in a data model?**\n",
    "   You create **aliases or views** of the same dimension with different join paths. Example: `Order Date`, `Ship Date`, `Delivery Date` ‚Äî all referencing the same `Date` dimension but used differently in the fact.\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **Can you describe a scenario where combining indicators into a junk dimension was helpful?**\n",
    "   For a `Transaction Fact`, combining attributes like `Is_Returned`, `Promo_Code_Applied`, and `Customer_Segment` into one `Junk_Dimension_Key` reduced clutter and kept the schema clean.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **What are the risks of putting too much into a junk dimension?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Cardinality explosion**: Too many combinations of flags\n",
    "   * Difficult to **interpret or maintain**\n",
    "   * Harder to **optimize** ETL if not thoughtfully grouped\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **How do junk dimensions help reduce clutter in fact tables?**\n",

    "\n",
    "   * **Type 0**: No change. Original value is preserved.\n",
    "   * **Type 1**: Overwrite. New value replaces old one (e.g., customer name correction).\n",
    "   * **Type 2**: Versioning. Add new row for change (e.g., customer changes address).\n",
    "   * **Type 3**: Add column for previous value (e.g., previous region code).\n",
    "   * **Hybrid**: Mix of above (e.g., track important changes with Type 2, ignore others).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **When would you use Type 1 vs Type 2 vs Type 3 SCD?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **Type 1**: When data correction is needed (e.g., fixing typos).\n",
    "   * **Type 2**: When **historical tracking** is essential (e.g., customer moved city).\n",
    "   * **Type 3**: When you only care about the **previous** and **current** value.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **How do you manage versioning and surrogate keys in Type 2 SCD?**\n",

    "\n",
    "2. **How do mini-dimensions help with managing rapidly changing attributes?**\n",
    "\n",
    "   * They allow tracking of **customer behavior or demographics** without bloating the main dimension\n",
    "   * Paired with a **Type 1 or static dimension**, you can manage both **current** and **historical** perspectives efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Can you explain a case where you split a large dimension into mini-dimensions?**\n",
