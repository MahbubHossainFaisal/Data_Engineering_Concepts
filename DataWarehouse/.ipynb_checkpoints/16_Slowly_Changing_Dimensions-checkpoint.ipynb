    "## 🔷 What is SCD (Slowly Changing Dimension)?\n",
    "\n",
    "A **Slowly Changing Dimension (SCD)** is a **dimension table** in a data warehouse that stores **attributes that change slowly over time** (unlike transaction data, which changes frequently).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📌 Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "To manage **historical changes** in dimensional data while supporting accurate **trend** and **point-in-time** analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 📌 Real-Life Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s say you are tracking customers in a **retail company**. A customer may:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Change their **address**\n",
    "* Get **married** (change of last name)\n",
    "* Switch **loyalty tiers**\n",
    "\n",
    "You need a mechanism to either:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Keep the **latest** value only\n",
    "* Store a **limited** history\n",
    "* Store the **complete** history\n",

    "* Any update to this field is **ignored**.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> I use **SCD Type 1** when historical data is **not important**, and I only care about the **latest value**. This is suitable for correcting errors or for attributes that change infrequently and do not affect analysis — like fixing a spelling mistake or updating an email address.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> I use **SCD Type 2** when it’s critical to **track historical changes** over time. This is necessary when we want to do **point-in-time reporting** or trend analysis. For example, if a customer moves from Delhi to Mumbai, I want to know **when** the change happened, and be able to track **sales by location** accordingly.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> In SCD Type 2, I preserve history by keeping **multiple versions** of the same record, each with a **time window** of validity.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The ETL logic includes:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Lookup** the current record from the dimension table using a natural key (e.g., customer\\_id).\n",
    "> 2. **Compare** incoming values with existing values.\n",
    "> 3. If a change is detected:\n",

    "### ✅ **3. What role does surrogate key play in SCD Type 2?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> In SCD Type 2, **surrogate keys** are essential because:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * A single **natural key** like `customer_id` will have **multiple versions** (rows) over time.\n",
    "> * Without surrogate keys, it would be **impossible to uniquely identify** each historical version.\n",
    "> * They help maintain **referential integrity** between the fact table and the dimension table.\n",
    ">\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **4. Can SCD Type 3 and Type 2 be combined?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> Yes, they can be combined — this is typically referred to as **SCD Type 6 (Hybrid)**.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> In SCD Type 6:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * We use **Type 2** to track all historical changes (with rows and dates).\n",
    "> * We also maintain **Type 3-style columns**, like `previous_department`, to allow easy access to the most recent changes.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> This gives flexibility: **quick comparison** (Type 3) and **deep history** (Type 2) in the same table.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> However, it comes with increased **complexity** in ETL and data modeling, so I use this only when business explicitly requires **both behaviors**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **5. How would you manage large volumes of historical data in dimension tables?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> For high-volume SCD Type 2 tables, I follow these best practices:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> 1. **Partitioning** the dimension table by `effective_from_date` to speed up queries.\n",
    "> 2. **Indexing** on natural key and current\\_flag (or `to_date IS NULL`) to improve lookup performance.\n",
    "> 3. Keeping only **current data in a separate view** (or mini dimension) for fast access in dashboards.\n",
    "> 4. Using **data archival strategies** (move older records to cheaper storage like S3 or cold layer).\n",
    "> 5. Using **hash-based change detection** in ETL to avoid unnecessary updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ **6. If your business user says they want to see the “previous region of a customer,” what SCD would you choose?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> In this case, we only care about the **previous and current** values — not the entire history.\n",
    "> So I would choose **SCD Type 3**.\n",

    ">\n",
    "> * A column for `current_region`\n",
    "> * A column for `previous_region`\n",

    "> The ETL would:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> * Move the value of `current_region` into `previous_region`\n",
    "> * Update `current_region` with the new value\n",
    "\n",
