    "\n",
    "* Adds **business-friendly attributes** (e.g., fiscal quarters, month names).\n",
    "* Enables **fast filtering**, **grouping**, and **hierarchical drilldowns**.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ 6. **What’s the best surrogate key format for a Date Dimension and why?**\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ Recommended: **Integer in `YYYYMMDD` format**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Example: `20240504`\n",
    "* Sortable chronologically\n",
    "* Easily human-readable\n",
    "* Works well as a **natural surrogate key** without need for an auto-increment ID\n",

    "### ✅ 7. **How do you populate and refresh a Date Dimension table?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Load**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a script (SQL or Python) to generate dates for a range (e.g., 2000–2040).\n",
    "* Add derived fields like month name, quarter, fiscal info, holidays, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Refresh Strategy**:\n",

    "  * Update rows for **holiday flags** or **new fiscal settings** as needed.\n",
