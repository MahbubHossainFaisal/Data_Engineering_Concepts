    "##  QUESTIONS WITH ANSWERS: Dimensional Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. **What is dimensional modeling and why is it important in a data warehouse?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Dimensional modeling is a design technique optimized for data retrieval in analytical systems like data warehouses. It structures data into **fact tables** (measurable events) and **dimension tables** (descriptive context), often forming a **star or snowflake schema**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Importance:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Makes querying faster and simpler for BI tools and analysts.\n",
    "* Improves **understandability** for business users.\n",
    "* Supports **performance-optimized** aggregations and drill-downs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. **What is a fact table? What types of fact tables exist?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A fact table is the **central table** in a dimensional model. It contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Measures (facts)**: numerical data like revenue, units sold.\n",
    "* **Foreign keys** to dimension tables.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Transactional fact** ‚Äì Each row is a business event (e.g., a sale).\n",
    "* **Periodic snapshot** ‚Äì Captures metrics at regular intervals (e.g., daily account balance).\n",
    "* **Accumulating snapshot** ‚Äì Shows progress of a process (e.g., order ‚Üí shipped ‚Üí delivered).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. **What is a derived fact table?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A **derived fact** table contains **calculated measures** derived from base facts. Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "* From a `SALES_FACT` table, you derive a `PROFIT_FACT` table by calculating `REVENUE - COST`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Used when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Complex calculations are needed frequently.\n",
    "* Performance is critical.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. **What is a factless fact table? Can you give an example?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A **factless fact table** records the **occurrence of an event** but has **no numeric fact**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "A student attendance tracking table:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "FACT_ATTENDANCE(student_id, class_id, date_key)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Äì No numeric facts, but it shows **who attended what and when**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. **What is a dimension table? How do you identify them?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Dimension tables provide **descriptive context** to facts: \"Who\", \"What\", \"When\", \"Where\", \"How\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example dimensions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Customer\n",
    "* Product\n",
    "* Time\n",
    "* Location\n",
    "\n",
    "**Identification approach:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Ask business-driven questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Who** is involved? (customer, employee)\n",
    "  * **What** is the product?\n",
    "  * **Where** is the transaction happening?\n",
    "  * **How** was the item delivered?\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. **What is granularity in a fact table and how do you define it?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "**Granularity** is the **level of detail** stored in a fact table.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* Low granularity: Daily sales per store.\n",
    "* High granularity: Each item sold in each transaction.\n",
    "\n",
    "You define it by:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Business goals (e.g., do we need line-level insights?)\n",
    "* Operational data structure\n",
    "* Storage and performance needs\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. **Why and when are views used in a data warehouse?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "**Views** are logical tables built on top of physical tables using SQL queries. They‚Äôre used to:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Simplify complex logic** for business users.\n",
    "* Apply **business rules** without modifying base tables.\n",
    "* Create **security layers** to mask sensitive columns.\n",
    "* Support **virtual data marts** without duplicating data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "Instead of querying a complex join across 5 tables, you expose a view `vw_SalesSummary` that returns the pre-joined, cleaned data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. **What is the purpose of dimensional modeling in transforming staging to access layer?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Dimensional modeling converts **raw, normalized data** into **user-friendly, analytical structures**.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Staging layer** holds raw data from sources.\n",
    "* **Transformation process** applies business logic, joins, lookups, and deduplication.\n",
    "* **Access layer** stores the final star/snowflake schema for reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Without dimensional modeling:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Users would deal with complex schemas.\n",
    "* Query performance would degrade.\n",
    "* Business logic would be inconsistently applied.\n",

    "### 10. **What are slowly changing dimensions (SCD)? Why are they important?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "SCDs manage changes in dimension data over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Types:**\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Type 1**: Overwrite (no history kept)\n",
