    "## üß† **The Purpose of Transformation in Data Warehouse**\n",
    "\n",
    "When raw data is extracted from various **disparate source systems**, it is **dirty, inconsistent, misaligned, and unreadable for analytics**. The **transform layer** standardizes and reshapes it to make it *fit for dimensional modeling, business use, and reporting.*\n",

    "## üß± Key Concepts of Transformation\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. ‚úÖ **Uniformity**\n",
    "|\n",
    "**Uniformity** ensures data across all source systems looks and behaves consistently.\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° *Example*:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Country name appears as `US`, `USA`, `United States` across systems.\n",
    "* Transform this to a single standard: `United States`.\n",
    "\n",
    "üîß Techniques:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Standardized lookups\n",
    "* Mapping tables\n",
    "* Controlled vocabularies\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. üîß **Restructuring**\n",
    "\n",
    "This involves reshaping raw data into a model that is **analytically friendly**, such as:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normalizing flat files\n",
    "* Denormalizing for dimensional models (Star/Snowflake schema)\n",
    "* Splitting wide tables\n",
    "* Flattening nested structures (from JSON, XML, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° *Example*:\n",
    "A JSON file has orders, and each order has multiple products embedded. You'd flatten this to create:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Orders` table\n",
    "* `Order_Items` table (1\\:N relationship)\n",

    "\n",
    "This solves the issue of *semantic mismatches* across systems.\n",

    "**Problem**:\n",
    "Salesforce has `Gender = 'M' / 'F'`\n",
    "HR System has `Gender = 'Male' / 'Female'`\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix (Transform Layer)**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Use a mapping table to convert both to `'Male' / 'Female'`\n",

    "\n",
    "**Problem**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Date` in Oracle comes as `DD-MON-YY`\n",
    "* In CSV, it's `MM/DD/YYYY`\n",
    "* Phone numbers: integer vs. varchar(20)\n",
    "* VARCHAR(10) in one system truncates data when unioned with VARCHAR(50)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Normalize all date columns to `ISO 8601` (`YYYY-MM-DD`)\n",
    "* Pad and format phone numbers to consistent strings\n",
    "* Align data types and column lengths in transformation scripts\n",

    "### ‚úÖ 3. **Deduplication**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem**:\n",
    "Two systems both store user data. Customer `John Smith` exists twice with minor differences (email variation, address formatting).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Fix**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Define business rules (email or phone = primary identifier)\n",
    "* Use `ROW_NUMBER()` with `PARTITION BY` logic to retain most recent or accurate row\n",
    "* Optionally apply fuzzy matching for names and addresses\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ *Real World*:\n",
    "One company I worked with had over **15% duplicate customers** across CRM and E-commerce systems. After deduplication and SCD modeling, their segmentation accuracy increased massively.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Reduce size\n",
    "* Protect PII/PHI\n",
    "* Remove test data, anomalies\n",

    "\n",
    "* Drop fields like `debug_flag`, `last_modified_by`, `temp_id`\n",
    "* Drop records with invalid entries (`negative age`, `future birth date`, `blank keys`)\n",

    "* Normalize all missing values to `NULL`\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* Revenue is `NULL` in some rows ‚Üí fill with `0` to avoid breaking sum calculations.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "In one of my recent projects for a healthcare provider, we extracted patient records from 4 systems: Electronic Health Records (EHR), Insurance CRM, Appointments DB, and a CSV from a third-party lab.\n",
    "\n",
    "Key transformations I implemented:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data Value Standardization**: Unifying `Gender` values from `M/F`, `Male/Female`, and even numeric codes into a standard `Male/Female`.\n",
    "* **Date Unification**: Consolidating various date formats (e.g., `MM/DD/YYYY`, `YYYY-MM-DD`) into ISO format to simplify joins and reporting.\n",
    "* **Deduplication**: Using `ROW_NUMBER()` with patient email and phone to eliminate multiple copies of the same person across systems.\n",
    "* **Null Handling**: Filled `NULL` insurance amounts with `0` and replaced missing doctor names with `‚ÄòUnknown Physician‚Äô`.\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ *Why?*: These were essential for building consistent, accurate reports and maintaining trust in data.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ **2. How do you handle data standardization from multiple sources?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "I start with **profiling** the data using tools like **Great Expectations** or **custom SQL scripts** to understand data ranges, anomalies, and formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "Then I apply:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Mapping tables**: For standardizing values (e.g., country codes, product categories).\n",
    "* **Lookup dictionaries**: For business-specific mappings.\n",
    "* **Data type enforcement**: During transformation, ensuring all similar fields conform to a single format (`VARCHAR`, `DATE`, etc.).\n",
    "* **Normalization logic**: Trim whitespaces, uppercase/lowercase unification, encoding fixes (UTF-8).\n",
    "\n",
    "üß∞ I often encapsulate this logic in reusable **transformation functions or stored procedures**, improving maintainability and consistency.\n",

    "üéØ *Logic*: If two customers share email + phone, retain the most recently updated row.\n",

    "### ‚úÖ **4. What strategy would you use to handle NULL values in revenue or category fields?**\n",
