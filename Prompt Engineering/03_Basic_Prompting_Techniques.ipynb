    "## 🔹 1. What is **Zero-Shot Prompting**?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Zero-shot prompting** means giving the model a task **without providing any example**.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name **\"zero-shot\"** literally stands for:\n",
    "\n",
    "> 🗯️ “Hey LLM, do this task — but I won't show you how.”\n",
    "\n",
    "You just **describe the task** clearly using natural language and hope the model uses its **general knowledge** to generate the answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 How It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are trained on **vast corpora** of internet text — they’ve seen tons of examples during training.\n",
    "\n",
    "With zero-shot prompting, you're relying on that **internal knowledge** + your **clear instruction**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "* For **simple or familiar tasks**, zero-shot saves tokens and works fast.\n",
    "* Use when you want quick output without investing time in examples.\n",
    "* Ideal when you're **testing initial ideas** or using tools like ChatGPT in an ad-hoc way.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Prompt (Zero-Shot):\n",
    "\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "Translate the following sentence to Spanish:\n",
    "\"I will go to the market tomorrow.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Output:\n",
    "\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "\"Iré al mercado mañana.\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model **understood the task** without needing a translation example.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 2. When Zero-Shot Doesn’t Work…\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs sometimes **struggle** when:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The task is **complex**\n",
    "* The desired output structure is **unusual**\n",
    "* There’s **ambiguity** in what you want\n",
    "\n",
    "📌 This is when we **add examples** → welcome to **one-shot and few-shot prompting**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 3. What is One-Shot Prompting?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You give the model **one example** of input + output to **show the desired format or logic**.\n",
    "\n",
    "This gives the model a *hint* or pattern to imitate.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```txt\n",
    "Task: Translate English to French\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "English: Where is the library?\n",
    "French: Où est la bibliothèque ?\n",
    "\n",
    "Now translate:\n",
    "English: What time is it?\n",
    "French:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The model will now mimic the format and respond correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 4. What is Few-Shot Prompting?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "> You provide **multiple examples** to guide the model’s behavior more reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Typically, **3–5 well-chosen examples** are enough to help it generalize to a new input.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 Why It Works:\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs learn **via pattern recognition**.\n",
    "Showing multiple examples helps them **see the structure**, **tone**, **style**, and **format** you want.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're building an **email subject line generator** for different products.\n",
    "Zero-shot might generate vague titles. Few-shot helps define your **style rules**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "### ⚠️ Best Practices for Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **High quality**: Mistakes confuse the model.\n",
    "* **Diverse**: Covers edge cases and variations.\n",
    "* **Well formatted**: Clear, structured, and matching your desired pattern.\n",
    "* **Token-efficient**: Stay within input length limits.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ❗Edge Case Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're building **robust systems**, include **edge cases** in examples.\n",

    "#### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "For a sentiment classifier:\n",
    "\n",

    "Text: \"I didn’t expect to like it, but I did.\"\n",
    "Label: Positive\n",
