ðŸ§  **How to Write a Tree of Thought (ToT) Prompt**

I already discussed in my previous post about what ToT prompting is â€” a way to guide reasoning through multiple possibilities before arriving at the best answer.
But how do you actually **write** one?

Letâ€™s break it down with an interesting and exciting problemðŸ‘‡

ðŸ¦‡ ToT in Action â€” Batmanâ€™s AI Assistant

To solve a life-threatening riddle from the Riddler, Batman turns to his AI assistant and feeds it this prompt:

**Prompt**:
You are a multi-strategy reasoning engine. Solve the following problem using the Tree of Thought approach:

- Generate multiple possible thoughts (ideas, partial answers, or strategies) 
- For each, explain the reasoning behind why it might work 
- Score each thought based on criteria such as clarity, logic fit, accuracy, or symbolism 
- Select the best path and present the final answer, grounded in the reasoning process

**Problem:**
*"I speak without a mouth, and hear without ears. I have no body, but I come alive with the wind. What am I?"*

Here how Batman's AI assistant might reply:

âœ… Step 1: Generate Thoughts

* **Thought A**: Echo
* **Thought B**: Shadow
* **Thought C**: Wind Instrument
* **Thought D**: Ghost
* **Thought E**: Whisper

ðŸ§  Step 2: Reason Through Each

**Echo**
âœ” Speaks without a mouth
âœ” Hears without ears
âœ” Has no body
âœ” Comes alive with reflected sound (poetically linked to wind)
â†’ Strong literal and metaphorical match

**Shadow**
âœ” No body
âœ˜ Doesnâ€™t speak or hear
âœ˜ Moves with light, not wind

**Wind Instrument**
âœ” Makes sound
âœ” Needs wind
âœ˜ Has a physical body
âœ˜ Doesnâ€™t hear

**Ghost**
âœ” Fits metaphorically
âž– Vague and less precise

**Whisper**
âœ” Can be carried by wind
âœ˜ Requires a mouth to exist
âœ˜ Doesnâ€™t fully meet all conditions


ðŸ§¾ Step 3: Scoring

| Thought     | Clarity | Fit to Riddle | Symbolism | Accuracy | Total |
| --------------- | ------- | ------------- | --------- | -------- | ------ |
| **Echo**    | 10   | 10      | 9     | 10    | **39** |
| Shadow     | 6    | 5       | 8     | 5    | 24   |
| Wind Instrument | 7    | 6       | 7     | 6    | 26   |
| Ghost      | 8    | 7       | 10    | 5    | 30   |
| Whisper     | 7    | 6       | 7     | 6    | 26   |

ðŸŽ¯ Step 4: Final Answer

**Final Thought Chosen**: **Echo**

âœ… The Batcomputer beeps
âœ… The screen flashes green
âœ… Hostage location unlocked

**Batman wins â€” again.**
