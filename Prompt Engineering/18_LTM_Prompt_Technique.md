**Least-to-Most Prompting: Teaching an AI to Think Like a Real Engineer**

One of the most effective prompting techniques for complex reasoning is Least-to-Most Prompting (LTM). Instead of giving an AI one giant, complicated problem to solve in a single step, you break it down into smaller, simpler subproblems and gradually increase the difficulty.
This mirrors how humans naturally solve challenges.

** What happens if we don’t? **
If we present the big problem directly, a language model may:
- Skip important details.
- Oversimplify the problem (treating it as a straight calculation when it has multiple conditions).
- Make arithmetic slips due to handling too many numbers at once.
- Lose track of logical constraints (like forgetting when certain rules start to apply).
- In short, the model may produce a quick but incorrect answer.

Let's see an interesting scenario on this:

Tony is helping Wakanda defend against Thanos’s army. 
He is deploying his Iron Legion and needs to know how long his suits can fight before the Arc Reactor drains.

** The big problem: **
Tony Stark needs to calculate how long his Arc Reactor can sustain the Iron Legion in battle. The Legion consists of 200 heavy-combat suits, each consuming 30 units of energy per hour; 400 mid-combat suits, each consuming 20 units per hour; and 600 scout suits, each consuming 10 units per hour. The Arc Reactor begins with 200,000 units of energy, but due to overheating, it loses 2% of its remaining energy every hour. To make matters more complex, beginning in the 3rd hour of the battle, 50 emergency drones are activated, and each drone consumes 5 units of energy per hour.

** Tony asks to J A R V I S: How long until the Arc Reactor is drained? **

This is exactly the kind of question that can overwhelm an AI if asked all at once. Instead of solving everything in one step, we can instruct AI from least to most complex scenarios:

1. First, let’s figure out the energy demand of just one group: How much energy do the 200 heavy suits consume per hour if each uses 30 units?

2. Now that we know the heavy suits’ consumption, let’s add the next group: Including the 400 mid suits that each use 20 units/hour, what is the combined hourly consumption of the heavy and mid suits?

3.Let’s bring in the last group of suits: When we also include the 600 scout suits that each use 10 units/hour, what is the total hourly consumption of all the suits combined?

4. With the Legion’s base consumption known, let’s add the conditional factor: Starting from the 3rd hour, 50 drones join the fight at 5 units/hour each. How does this change the Legion’s hourly energy usage after hour three?

5. So far we’ve only considered the suits and drones. But the Arc Reactor itself is unstable: If it loses 2% of its remaining energy each hour, how does this compounding decay affect the available energy as time progresses?

6. Finally, putting it all together: Given the Arc Reactor starts with 200,000 units, how many hours can it sustain the Legion’s energy needs before being completely drained?

- By layering the prompts this way, the AI is far less likely to skip details or oversimplify. Each step locks in part of the logic and cumulatively making the final solution more reliable.
The takeaway

- If Tony Stark dumped the entire problem on JARVIS at once, even an advanced AI might trip over missing details or wrong assumptions. But by decomposing the problem into subproblems, we ensure clarity, accuracy, and robustness.
- Just like Tony never jumped from Mark I to Mark 50 without the intermediate suits, we shouldn’t expect an AI to handle the “final boss” version of a problem without building it up step by step.
