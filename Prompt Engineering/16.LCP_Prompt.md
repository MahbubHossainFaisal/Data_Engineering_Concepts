Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP)
    - LCP is a prompt engineering framework introduced in a research paper titled "Learning from Contrastive Prompts: Automated Optimization and Adaptation" by Li et al., published in September 2024 (submitted to ICLR 2025)
- Core Idea
    - Most existing prompt optimization methods train using only incorrect prompts, which risks overfitting to failure cases.

    - LCP instead uses contrastive learning — it learns by analyzing both good (effective) and bad (ineffective) prompt examples, learning to distinguish what works from what doesn't 

- How It Works
    - Prompt Candidate Generation: Produce a diverse set of potential prompts.

    - Contrastive Learning Stage: Compare "good" vs "bad" prompts and teach the model to favor patterns in the effective ones.

    - Prompt Adaptation: Not only optimize prompts but also adapt them across different model versions, families, and even languages — making LCP flexible and robust 

- Performance
    - On the BIG-Bench Hard benchmark, LCP achieved a win rate over 76% compared to other optimization methods like OPRO and AutoHint.

- Let’s break Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP) into an example.

- Scenario: Teaching an LLM to Write Better Email Subject Lines


Stage 1 – Collect Your Dataset (Good vs Bad)
We start by gathering good and bad examples.

Good (Effective) Examples:

“Unlock Your Free Trial – Ends Tonight!”

“Your Personalized Workout Plan is Ready”

“Boost Your Productivity with This Free Tool”

Bad (Ineffective) Examples:

“Email Newsletter #5”

“READ THIS NOW!!!”

“Product Update Info”

- Why this matters:
LCP needs both sides so the model can compare.

Stage 2 – Contrastive Reasoning Prompt
We teach the AI to spot differences between good and bad.

Prompt to AI:
You are a marketing expert. 
Compare the following subject lines and explain why the first one is better than the second.

Good: "Unlock Your Free Trial – Ends Tonight!"
Bad: "Email Newsletter #5"

Explain in detail:
1. What makes the good one engaging?
2. What makes the bad one ineffective?
3. Summarize the key principles from this comparison.


Expected AI reasoning:

Good: Urgency (“Ends Tonight”), clear benefit (“Free Trial”)

Bad: Generic, no benefit, no urgency

Stage 3 – Pattern Extraction Prompt
Once we’ve compared enough pairs, we extract rules.

Prompt to AI:
Based on these comparisons between good and bad subject lines, extract the key principles that make a subject line effective. 
List them as clear bullet points.
Expected AI output:

Use clear and specific benefits.

Add urgency or exclusivity when possible.

Keep it short and easy to scan.

Avoid spammy all-caps or overuse of punctuation.

Make it feel personal when possible.

Stage 4 – Generation Prompt (Applying the Learned Patterns)
Now we generate new subject lines that follow the learned rules.

Prompt to AI:

Using the principles extracted earlier, generate 5 new email subject lines for a fitness app’s summer campaign.
They must:
- Be short and engaging
- Show clear benefit
- Add a sense of urgency
- Avoid spammy formatting
Expected AI output:

“Summer Shred Plan – Start Today!”

“Your Personalized Diet Plan Awaits”

“Lose 5 lbs Before July – Join Now”

“Exclusive 3-Day Fitness Challenge”

“Get Stronger This Week – Don’t Miss Out”

How This Mimics LCP
Stage 1 → Collect examples (Good & Bad)

Stage 2 → Compare to find differences (Contrastive Reasoning)

Stage 3 → Extract the patterns

Stage 4 → Apply patterns to make better outputs

If you repeat this cycle over and over — with different topics and styles — you’re doing manual Learning from Contrastive Prompts.






**Learning from Contrastive Prompts (LCP) – Another Smarter Way to Optimize Prompts**

LCP is a prompt engineering framework introduced by Li et al. (Sept 2024, submitted to ICLR 2025) that changes how we make AI better at following prompts.

**What Makes LCP Different?**

* Most optimization methods train only on bad prompts, which can cause overfitting to failure cases.
* LCP uses *contrastive learning* — it learns from **both good and bad prompts**, identifying patterns in what works and what doesn’t.

**How LCP Works**

1. **Prompt Candidate Generation** – Create a diverse set of prompts.
2. **Contrastive Learning** – Compare good vs bad prompts and teach the model to favor effective patterns.
3. **Prompt Adaptation** – Adapt optimized prompts across different models, families, and even languages.

**Why It Matters**

* Scored **76% win rate** on BIG-Bench Hard vs methods like OPRO and AutoHint.
* Produces prompts that are flexible, robust, and transferable.



**Example – Teaching AI to Write Better Email Subject Lines**

**Stage 1 – Collect Your Dataset (Good vs Bad)**
Good (Effective) Examples:

* Unlock Your Free Trial – Ends Tonight!
* Your Personalized Workout Plan is Ready
* Boost Your Productivity with This Free Tool

Bad (Ineffective) Examples:

* Email Newsletter #5
* READ THIS NOW!!!
* Product Update Info

Why? LCP needs both sides so the model can compare.


**Stage 2 – Contrastive Reasoning Prompt**
Prompt to AI:
You are a marketing expert. Compare the following subject lines and explain why the first one is better than the second.

Good: Unlock Your Free Trial – Ends Tonight!
Bad: Email Newsletter #5

Explain in detail:

1. What makes the good one engaging?
2. What makes the bad one ineffective?
3. Summarize the key principles from this comparison.

Expected AI reasoning:

* Good: Urgency (“Ends Tonight”), clear benefit (“Free Trial”)
* Bad: Generic, no benefit, no urgency

**Stage 3 – Pattern Extraction Prompt**

* Use clear and specific benefits
* Add urgency or exclusivity when possible
* Keep it short and easy to scan
* Avoid spammy formatting
* Make it feel personal when possible

**Stage 4 – Generation Prompt (Applying the Learned Patterns)**
Prompt to AI:
Using the principles above, generate 5 new email subject lines for a fitness app’s summer campaign.

Expected AI output:

* Summer Shred Plan – Start Today!
* Your Personalized Diet Plan Awaits
* Lose 5 lbs Before July – Join Now
* Exclusive 3-Day Fitness Challenge
* Get Stronger This Week – Don’t Miss Out

**How This Mimics LCP**

* Stage 1 → Collect examples (Good & Bad)
* Stage 2 → Compare differences (Contrastive Reasoning)
* Stage 3 → Extract patterns
* Stage 4 → Apply patterns to generate better results

Repeat this cycle across topics and styles — you’re manually doing **Learning from Contrastive Prompts**.
