**Step Back Prompting*?**

We all are familiar with basic prompt techniques like zero-shot and few-shot prompting! But here's a powerful next step to level up your prompt engineering game.

**🧠 What is Step Back Prompting?**
It’s a technique where you ask the LLM to **reflect first**—before giving an answer.
This helps guide the model's thinking to match **your desired tone, structure, and logic.**

Let's dive into an interesting example below.

**🎬 Example Scenario: Writing a storyline for Iron Man 4 in the current Marvel Cinematic Universe**

🔸 **Regular Prompt:**
*"Write a storyline for Iron Man 4 in the Marvel Cinematic Universe."*

❗ Common issues with LLM:

* Might mix comic canon with MCU
* May Ignore character development arcs
* Hallucinates plots/events
* Breaks tone and pacing
* Add villains who might not relate to current scenario of MCU.

Here is how step back prompting help us to resolve the issues.

**✅ Step Back Prompt Version:**

"Write a storyline for Iron Man 4 in the MCU. But before that, reflect on the following:

1. Must continue from the existing MCU canon
2. Honor Tony Stark’s development arc and emotional legacy
3. Include a **plausible** way to bring him back
4. Make the tone **stronger and more intense** than past Iron Man films
5. Villain must be the **strongest** among all Iron Man movies
6. Include scenes that highlight Tony’s **intellect and innovation**

Then propose the storyline based on these reflections"

**🎯 Why It Works:**
This method makes the LLM “think before speaking” — just like a human would in real-life brainstorming.
