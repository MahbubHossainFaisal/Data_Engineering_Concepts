    "## 🔹 1. What is Step-Back Prompting?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Step-back prompting** is a strategy where instead of directly asking the model to perform a task, you first ask it to *reflect*, *analyze*, or *plan* — and then perform the task based on that reflection.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Simple Analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you're writing an essay. Instead of jumping in right away, you first:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Outline key points\n",
    "* Think about the theme\n",
    "* Decide on tone and structure\n",
    "\n",
    "Only *then* do you begin writing.\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s **step-back prompting** — let the model **plan**, then **act**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 2. What’s the Concept?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* LLMs are **brilliant pattern recognizers**, but they do better when they **slow down** and think before outputting.\n",
    "* By **breaking down a task** or **adding a meta-step**, you make the model **more accurate, creative, and structured**.\n",

    "> Iron Man returns to stop a rogue AI threatening the multiverse. Tony Stark is resurrected using time travel by Doctor Strange, and he assembles a new team to defend Earth from cosmic threats.\n",

    "3. Plausible narrative mechanisms (without breaking canon) to bring Iron Man back.\n",
    "4. The tone and themes consistent with previous Iron Man films.\n",

    "- Tony Stark died, but left behind tech and AI backups like EDITH and Friday.\n",
