    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tree of Thoughts (ToT)** is a prompting and reasoning framework that enables a language model to **explore multiple reasoning paths in parallel**, like a decision tree ‚Äî and evaluate or backtrack when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of committing to one chain like in Chain-of-Thought, ToT explores **multiple partial thoughts**, branching them out, scoring them, and picking the most promising branch.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîπ 2. The Core Concept of ToT\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you‚Äôre solving a logic puzzle. You try **one idea**, then another. You explore 2‚Äì3 options **before deciding which one is best**.\n",
