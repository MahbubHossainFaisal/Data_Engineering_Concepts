    "## 🔹 1. What is ReAct?\n",
    "\n",
    "### ✅ Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "> **ReAct** is a prompting framework that enables large language models to **combine reasoning with actions** (like using a tool, performing a search, calling a function) in a **feedback loop** to solve complex tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "The name comes from:\n",
    "\n",
    "* 🧠 **RE**ason\n",
    "* ⚙️ **ACT**ion\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔹 2. What’s the Core Concept?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs are **great at reasoning**, but sometimes they need **external tools** (like:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Google search,\n",
    "* calculator,\n",
    "* Python,\n",
    "* database,\n",
    "* weather API)\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of **hallucinating**, ReAct lets the model **reason, call a tool, observe the result**, and update its reasoning accordingly.\n",

    "| ❌ Hallucination                | ✅ Uses external tools for factual accuracy |\n",

    "## 🔹 4. Why ReAct Mirrors Human Thinking\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of how you solve problems:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 🧠 Think: “How can I find the distance between NYC and Paris?”\n",
    "2. 🔍 Act: Search on Google\n",
    "3. 👁️ Observe: Get the answer — 5,839 km\n",
    "4. 🧠 Think again: “Okay, that means a flight will take around 7–8 hours.”\n",
    "\n",
    "That’s exactly what ReAct enables in LLMs — **reason-action-observation loops**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 🔁 5. Thought → Action → Observation Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "Each iteration involves:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Thought** – “What do I need to know or do next?”\n",
    "2. **Action** – Call a tool (e.g., search, calculate, lookup)\n",
    "3. **Observation** – See the result\n",
    "4. **New Thought** – Update plan\n",
    "5. **Next Action** – Repeat until done\n",
