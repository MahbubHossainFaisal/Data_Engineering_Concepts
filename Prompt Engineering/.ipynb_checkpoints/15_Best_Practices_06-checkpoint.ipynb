    "* A chatbot for a datamart agent\n",

    "‚Ä¶these best practices apply across all of them.\n",

    "## üß± 1. **Put Instructions at the Beginning and Use Delimiters (### or \"\"\" or \\`\\`\\`)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéì Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "The model **reads instructions more reliably when they‚Äôre at the top** ‚Äî just like humans.\n",
    "Delimiters (like `###`, `\"\"\"`, or even `---`) help **visually and semantically separate** your instruction from your data or context.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Best Practice Format:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "You are a legal contract simplifier. Simplify complex legal clauses into plain English.\n",
    "\n",
    "###\n",
    "\n",
    "Clause: \"The aforementioned party shall retain sole discretion to terminate the agreement...\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine reading a test paper. If the instructions are in the middle, you'd probably miss them. Same with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîç 2. **Be Specific, Descriptive, and Detailed**\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéì Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "Vague prompts produce vague outputs. The model performs better when it knows:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **What kind of output** you want\n",
    "* **How long** it should be\n",
    "* **What style or tone** to use\n",
    "* **What kind of data** to operate on\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Vague Prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Write a summary of this article.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Better Prompt:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Summarize the following article in 3 concise bullet points using formal tone. Focus on business impact, not technical details.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† The more constraints you give, the less the model has to ‚Äúguess‚Äù.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üì¶ 3. **Use Examples to Articulate Output Format (Few-Shot Prompting)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéì Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "LLMs **learn from the structure you give**. If you show it **how you want the answer**, it mimics the structure in future completions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Convert the following complex sentences into simple sentences.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Input: The individual failed to ascertain the required documentation.\n",
    "Output: They didn‚Äôt get the paperwork.\n",
    "\n",
    "Input: The weather phenomenon caused significant infrastructural damage.\n",
    "Output:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "‚Üí The model learns the pattern:\n",
    "`Input: ‚Ä¶ ‚Üí Output: ‚Ä¶`\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß† Teaching Analogy:\n",
    "\n",
    "You wouldn‚Äôt teach someone to play guitar just by saying \"play better.\" You‚Äôd show **examples** of chords or tabs. Same with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ü™Ñ 4. **Start with Zero-Shot ‚Üí Then Few-Shot ‚Üí Then Fine-Tune**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the **tiered prompt engineering strategy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Zero-shot**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Just give an instruction.\n",
    "‚úÖ Fast\n",
    "‚úÖ Cheap\n",
    "‚úÖ Often works surprisingly well\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Extract all dates from this paragraph.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Few-shot**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Add examples if zero-shot fails to follow format.\n",
    "\n",
    "```plaintext\n",
    "Extract all dates from this paragraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Text: \"The event is on July 3rd and again on September 9th.\"\n",
    "Dates: July 3rd, September 9th\n",
    "\n",
    "Text: \"Her birthday is May 15.\"\n",
    "Dates:\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Fine-tune**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Only if few-shot doesn‚Äôt give consistency, and you need 1000s of repeated similar outputs (like invoices, medical codes, logs).\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† This **saves time, cost**, and keeps things flexible.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚úÇÔ∏è 5. **Reduce ‚ÄúFluffy‚Äù or Imprecise Descriptions**\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Bad:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Be a little creative, not too boring, but also sort of helpful.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Good:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Use an informative tone with slight humor, targeting first-year university students. Write in short, punchy paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† Why? The model doesn‚Äôt understand \"a little\" or \"sort of\" ‚Äî it‚Äôs not mind-reading, it‚Äôs pattern matching.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÅ 6. **Instead of Just Saying What NOT to Do, Say What TO DO Instead**\n",
    "\n",
    "This is crucial. LLMs don‚Äôt understand negation as well as we think.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Bad:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Don‚Äôt make it too technical.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Good:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Explain it in layman‚Äôs terms, as if teaching a 12-year-old student. Avoid jargon.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Bad:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Don‚Äôt answer with too much detail.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Good:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Give 3 bullet points, each no more than 10 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† The model follows **positive constraints** better than **negative ones**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üíª 7. **Code Generation Specific: Use ‚ÄúLeading Words‚Äù to Nudge the Model**\n",
    "\n",
    "In code generation tasks, **prefix context matters heavily**. LLMs autocomplete ‚Äî they don‚Äôt plan ahead.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Leading Prompts:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Function to calculate factorial of a number\n",
    "def factorial(n):\n",
