    "Instead of:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Q: What is 12 * 15?  \n",
    "A: 180\n",
    "```\n",

    "A: Let's think step-by-step.  \n",
    "12 * 15 = (10 * 15) + (2 * 15) = 150 + 30 = 180.  \n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 🔹 1. Put **Answer After Reasoning**\n",
    "\n",

    "#### 🔹 2. Use \"Let's think step by step\"\n",
    "\n",
    "This phrase **triggers** reasoning behavior because the model was trained on millions of examples of that pattern.\n",

    "```\n",
    "Q: Jane has 3 apples. She buys 5 more. Then she eats 2. How many apples left?  \n",
    "A: Let's think step by step.  \n",
    "Jane starts with 3 apples.  \n",
    "She buys 5 → 3 + 5 = 8.  \n",

    "#### 🔹 3. **Set Temperature to 0**\n",
