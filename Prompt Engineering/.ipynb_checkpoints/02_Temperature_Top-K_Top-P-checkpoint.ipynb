    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ Definition:\n",
    "\n",
    "Top-K sampling means:\n",
    "\n",
    "> From the **K most probable tokens**, **randomly** select the next one.\n",
    "\n",
    "So instead of always picking the #1 most likely next word, you limit the AI's vocabulary to the top **K** choices and let it pick **randomly** within that.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üéØ Purpose:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To **add diversity** to output without making it chaotic.\n",
    "* Prevents the model from picking an ultra-low-probability, irrelevant word.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîß Use Case:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Great for **semi-creative** tasks: story generation, brainstorming, summarizing with flair.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° What Problem It Solves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem:** Greedy decoding (always picking the top word) creates **bland**, **repetitive**, and **deterministic** output.\n",
    "* **Solution:** Top-K adds controlled randomness ‚Äî enough to make output natural and non-repetitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "\n",
    "Top-P chooses from the **smallest number of tokens** whose cumulative probability is at least **P** (like 0.9).\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üí° What Problem It Solves:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Problem with Top-K:** It's a **fixed list** ‚Äî even if probabilities drop off sharply.\n",
