I will write a post regarding "Self Consistent Learning Prompt" post on linkedin to make people aware about it. I have created some point which need to be discussed. Before reading those points, you must reflect on the following rules: 
1. It has to be a simple linkedin post with plain text and bullet points (You can just highlight headers but ignore any "*" sign. Use only bullet points or hiphen).
2. It has to be concise and explicit. 
3. My input points, You can refine in the best way possible and then provide your response based on the refined points. 
4. What input I have provided, you have to make it well structured , organized and better understandable while providing response. So I want you to bring your best creativity there. 
5. My points maybe insufficient for proper context. so please judge and add other valuable points also which must need to be there for a better response or explanation. 
6. At last, Don't make it huge, instead Normal , easy to read and attractive tone. 
7. Create the post in such a way that it must gather the attraction of audience. 8. In the input, I have provided a lot of steps. Convert them into 5 steps of chaining prompt but make sure you don't skip any important context. 
9. At last do necessary changes/modifications to make it look attractive which audience find very interesting to read.

- The concept
- How it is similar to COT
- an Example scenario in the mcu

Scenario:
Nice choice ðŸ˜„ â€” letâ€™s anchor it in the **Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)** so itâ€™s more fun and memorable.

Weâ€™ll use **SCLP** with a reasoning question about the MCU.

---

### ðŸ¦¸ Scenario Question

*"If Tony Stark and Peter Parker are both working on the same problem, and Tony can solve it in 2 hours while Peter can solve it in 3 hours, how long would it take if they worked together?"*


---

### MCU Example

*"If Tony Stark can solve a problem in 2 hours, and Peter Parker can solve it in 3 hours, how long if they work together?"*

---

#### **Path A (Rate Addition)**

* Tonyâ€™s rate = 1/2 = **0.5 problems/hr**
* Peterâ€™s rate = 1/3 â‰ˆ **0.333 problems/hr**
* Combined rate = 0.5 + 0.333 = **0.833 problems/hr**
* Time = 1 Ã· 0.833 = **1.2 hours (72 minutes)**

---

#### **Path B â€” Fraction of Work (Fractional Method)**

In 1 hour, Tony completes 1/2 problem, Peter completes 1/3 problem â†’ together 5/6 problem

Remaining work = 1 â€“ 5/6 = 1/6 problem

Time to finish remaining 1/6 problem at combined rate = (1/6) Ã· (5/6) = 1/5 hr = 0.2 hr = 12 minutes

Total time = 1 hour + 0.2 hour = 1.2 hours (72 minutes)

---

#### **Path C (Common Denominator Approach)**

* LCM(2,3) = 6 hours.
* In 6 hrs: Tony = 3 problems, Peter = 2 problems â†’ **5 problems total**.
* So for 1 problem: 6 Ã· 5 = **1.2 hours (72 minutes)**.

---

âœ… Now we have 3 **distinct** reasoning paths:

* Path A = direct rate addition
* Path B = simulate hour by hour + finish leftover
* Path C = scale up with common denominator

All consistent: **72 minutes**.

- Now at last tell the most important points of SCLP.
