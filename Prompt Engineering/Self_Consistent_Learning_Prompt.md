- The concept
- How it is similar to COT
- an Example scenario in the mcu

Scenario:
Nice choice ðŸ˜„ â€” letâ€™s anchor it in the **Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU)** so itâ€™s more fun and memorable.

Weâ€™ll use **SCLP** with a reasoning question about the MCU.

---

### ðŸ¦¸ Scenario Question

*"If Tony Stark and Peter Parker are both working on the same problem, and Tony can solve it in 2 hours while Peter can solve it in 3 hours, how long would it take if they worked together?"*


---

### MCU Example

*"If Tony Stark can solve a problem in 2 hours, and Peter Parker can solve it in 3 hours, how long if they work together?"*

---

#### **Path A (Rate Addition)**

* Tonyâ€™s rate = 1/2 = **0.5 problems/hr**
* Peterâ€™s rate = 1/3 â‰ˆ **0.333 problems/hr**
* Combined rate = 0.5 + 0.333 = **0.833 problems/hr**
* Time = 1 Ã· 0.833 = **1.2 hours (72 minutes)**

---

#### **Path B â€” Fraction of Work (Fractional Method)**

In 1 hour, Tony completes 1/2 problem, Peter completes 1/3 problem â†’ together 5/6 problem

Remaining work = 1 â€“ 5/6 = 1/6 problem

Time to finish remaining 1/6 problem at combined rate = (1/6) Ã· (5/6) = 1/5 hr = 0.2 hr = 12 minutes

Total time = 1 hour + 0.2 hour = 1.2 hours (72 minutes)

---

#### **Path C (Common Denominator Approach)**

* LCM(2,3) = 6 hours.
* In 6 hrs: Tony = 3 problems, Peter = 2 problems â†’ **5 problems total**.
* So for 1 problem: 6 Ã· 5 = **1.2 hours (72 minutes)**.

---

âœ… Now we have 3 **distinct** reasoning paths:

* Path A = direct rate addition
* Path B = simulate hour by hour + finish leftover
* Path C = scale up with common denominator

All consistent: **72 minutes**.

- Now at last tell the most important points of SCLP.
