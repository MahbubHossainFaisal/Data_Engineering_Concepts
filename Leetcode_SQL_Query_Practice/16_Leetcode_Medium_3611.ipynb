    "# **Problem Statement: Identifying Employees with Excessive Meeting Hours**\n",

    "## **Objective:**\n",
    "The goal is to identify employees who consistently spend a significant amount of time in meetings (more than 20 hours per week) across multiple weeks. This helps in:\n",
    "- Recognizing overburdened employees.\n",
    "- Analyzing meeting-heavy departments.\n",
    "- Improving workload distribution.\n",

    "### **Key Metrics:**\n",
    "- **Eligibility Threshold:** A week is considered \"meeting-heavy\" if an employee spends >20 hours in meetings (assuming a 40-hour workweek).\n",
    "- **Consistency Check:** Only employees with **more than one** such week are reported.\n",
    "- **Output:** Employee details sorted by the number of heavy weeks (descending) and then by name.\n",
