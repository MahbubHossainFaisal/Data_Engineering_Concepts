    "### Possible optimization points:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Joining `covid_tests` to itself?**\n",
    "   You don’t join the table to itself here; you join the main table to the smaller CTE of first positives — which is good. Self-joins on large tables often hurt performance, but this avoids that.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Indexes:**\n",
    "   Make sure the `covid_tests` table has indexes on `(patient_id, test_date, result)` for fast filtering and sorting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid repeated scans:**\n",
    "   If the dataset is huge, sometimes splitting into multiple CTEs causes repeated scans. Some SQL engines inline CTEs, others materialize them. If your engine materializes, rewriting as a single query with window functions might be faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Window functions alternative:**\n",
    "   Using window functions like `ROW_NUMBER()` or `FILTER()` can sometimes be more performant and clearer:\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "```sql\n",

    "  FROM covid_tests\n",
    "  WHERE result = 'Negative'\n",
    ")\n",
    "SELECT \n",
    "  p.patient_id,\n",
    "  pat.patient_name,\n",
    "  pat.age,\n",
    "  DATEDIFF(day, p.test_date, n.test_date) AS recovery_time\n",
