    "## Problem: **Friends With No Mutual Friends** (LeetCode 3058)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description**\n",
    "\n",
    "We have a table **Friends** with columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Column Name | Type |\n",
    "| ----------- | ---- |\n",
    "| user_id1    | int  |\n",
    "| user_id2    | int  |\n",
    "\n",
    "Each row `(user_id1, user_id2)` indicates that `user_id1` and `user_id2` are friends (i.e. an undirected friendship relation). The pair `(user_id1, user_id2)` is the primary key, so each friendship appears exactly once.\n",
    "\n",
    "Write a query (or algorithm) to find all pairs of users who:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Are **friends with each other**, and\n",
    "2. Have **no mutual friends** (i.e. there is no third user who is a friend of both).\n",
    "\n",
    "Return the result ordered by `user_id1`, `user_id2` in ascending order.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Explanation and Key Points\n",
    "\n",
    "* “Mutual friend” means a third user `x` such that `x` is a friend of `user_id1` *and* `x` is a friend of `user_id2`.\n",
    "* Because the friendship is undirected, from table you should consider that `(u, v)` implies both directions: `u` ↔ `v`.\n",
    "* The output should list only those friend-pairs that **do not** share any other friend in common.\n",
