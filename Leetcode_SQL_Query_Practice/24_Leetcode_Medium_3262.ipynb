    "  * The window aggregation and final aggregation are linear, so **no `O(n^2)` self-join** cost.\n",
    "  * Much faster and more scalable than the self-join when employees have many shifts.\n",
    "* **Simplicity**: Clear logic, easy to reason about and maintain.\n",

    "# Edge cases & variants\n",
    "\n",
    "* If you need to **count overlapping pairs** (i.e., how many distinct overlapping pairs of shifts exist), you’d use a self-join (or more careful counting) — this query counts each shift at most once (counts number of shifts that overlap some earlier shift).\n",
    "* If your DB doesn’t support `ROWS BETWEEN ... 1 PRECEDING` with `MAX()` you can alternatively compute a cumulative max including current row and then compare with `GREATEST(end_time, LAG(cumulative_max))` tricks, but most modern DBs that support analytic functions handle the given form.\n",
    "* If intervals that touch at endpoints (e.g., `end_time = start_time`) should be considered overlapping, change `start_time < prev_max_end` to `start_time <= prev_max_end`.\n",
