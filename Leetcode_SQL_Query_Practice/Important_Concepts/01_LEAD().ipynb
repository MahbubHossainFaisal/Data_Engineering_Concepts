    "  The `LEAD()` window function lets you **look ahead** in your result set to fetch a value from a *subsequent row*, without needing a self-join or subquery.\n",

    "* **Syntax:**\n",

    "```sql\n",
    "LEAD(column_name [, offset, default_value]) OVER (PARTITION BY ... ORDER BY ...)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Parameters:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **column\\_name** → The column you want to look ahead in.\n",
    "2. **offset** (optional) → How many rows forward you want to look (default is `1`).\n",
    "3. **default\\_value** (optional) → The value to return if there is no next row (default is `NULL`).\n",
    "4. **OVER(...)** → Defines your window:\n",
    "\n",
    "   * **PARTITION BY** → Breaks data into groups (optional).\n",

    "1. **Inline next event:** you see the very next event type per device without any joins.\n",
    "2. **Timing:** compute seconds between events directly — useful for SLA checks, sensor health checks, anomaly detection.\n",
    "3. **Flagging:** `long_gap_flag = 1` for gaps > 60s (e.g., id = 3 → 70s). You can alert or aggregate these counts per device.\n",
