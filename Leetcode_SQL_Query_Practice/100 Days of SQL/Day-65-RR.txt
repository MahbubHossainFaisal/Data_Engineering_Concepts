/*
Task:


Identify user sessions.
A session is defined as a sequence of activities by a user where the time difference between consecutive events is less than or equal to 30 minutes.
If the time between two events exceeds 30 minutes, it's considered the start of a new session.


For each session, calculate the following metrics:

session_id (a unique identifier for each session)
session_start_time (the timestamp of the first event in the session)
session_end_time (the timestamp of the last event in the session)
session_duration (the difference between session_end_time and session_start_time)
event_count (the number of events in the session)



Sample Table: user_events data.
