    "In Snowflake, the way DML (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) is processed and committed differs from traditional databases like Oracle because of its cloud-native architecture. Let's walk through the steps and compare it to the Oracle process:\n",
    "\n",
    "### How DML is Processed and Committed in Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "When a DML statement is executed in Snowflake, here’s what happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Check for Similar Queries**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** In Snowflake, query execution is handled in **Virtual Warehouses** (compute resources). Similar to Oracle's Shared SQL Area, Snowflake will look for reusable execution plans if applicable, but this process is handled more dynamically with its query optimizer.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** Snowflake doesn't rely on a \"shared pool\" in the same way as Oracle. Its stateless architecture means there’s no dedicated area like Oracle’s Library Cache, but it optimizes queries at execution time.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Check Metadata (Data Dictionary)**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Snowflake relies on its **metadata services** to validate the query. It checks if the objects (tables, columns, etc.) exist and whether the user has the proper permissions.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** While Oracle uses a dedicated Data Dictionary Cache, Snowflake manages metadata centrally with its metadata services, ensuring consistency across clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Check for Cached Data and Prepare for Undo (Time Travel)**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** In Snowflake, there’s no traditional **Buffer Cache** or **Undo Segments** like in Oracle. Instead, it leverages its **result cache** to check for any cached results.\n",
    "   - For rollback and data integrity, Snowflake uses a feature called **Time Travel**, which allows users to view historical data and revert changes. This replaces the traditional undo mechanism.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** Snowflake doesn’t need an Undo Segment since it uses Time Travel and its versioned storage system, which keeps a history of changes automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Locking the Data (Optimistic Concurrency Control)**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Snowflake uses **Optimistic Concurrency Control** rather than locking data blocks in the traditional sense. This means it assumes no conflict will occur and only checks for conflicts when changes are committed.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** Oracle uses locks to prevent multiple transactions from modifying the same data. Snowflake, however, detects conflicts at commit time rather than locking data upfront.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) Make Changes in Micro-Partitions (Data Blocks)**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** In Snowflake, data is stored in **Micro-Partitions**. When a DML operation is performed, the changes are written to new micro-partitions rather than modifying existing ones.\n",
    "   - **Why?** This append-only mechanism ensures that Snowflake is highly efficient in managing large datasets.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** Instead of modifying the blocks in the buffer cache like Oracle, Snowflake writes changes to new micro-partitions. This approach is faster and more efficient for large-scale data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6) Return Feedback for the Change**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** After applying the DML changes, Snowflake provides feedback to the user, similar to Oracle.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** Snowflake processes and scales feedback dynamically since there’s no traditional client-server relationship. It handles feedback at the compute node level.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How **Commit** Happens in Snowflake\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write Changes to Micro-Partitions**: When a transaction is committed, Snowflake writes the changes to new micro-partitions. The old partitions are retained for **Time Travel** purposes.\n",
    "2. **Handle Versioning**: Snowflake's storage system is versioned, meaning the system keeps track of every change, allowing for rollbacks and snapshots (similar to Oracle’s Undo Segments but with automatic versioning).\n",
    "3. **Time Travel and Fail-safe**: Changes are stored in a way that allows users to revert to previous states within a certain time window, thanks to Snowflake's **Time Travel** and **Fail-safe** features.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences from Oracle\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Buffer Cache vs. Micro-Partitions**: Oracle modifies data in the buffer cache and then writes to disk. Snowflake, however, operates on micro-partitions and appends new ones rather than modifying existing data directly.\n",
    "- **Locks vs. Optimistic Concurrency**: Oracle uses locks to ensure data integrity during transactions, while Snowflake uses optimistic concurrency, assuming no conflicts and resolving them at commit time.\n",
    "- **Undo Segments vs. Time Travel**: Oracle uses undo segments to maintain a before-image of the data, allowing for rollbacks. Snowflake’s Time Travel feature provides a more flexible, built-in way to revert changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In Snowflake, DML processing focuses on:\n",
    "- Metadata management instead of buffer caching.\n",
    "- Micro-partitioning instead of traditional block management.\n",
    "- Time Travel and versioning instead of undo segments."
