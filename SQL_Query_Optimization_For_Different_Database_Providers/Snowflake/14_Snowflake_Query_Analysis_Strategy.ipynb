    "### Snowflake Query Analysis Strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When to Use This Strategy**  \n",
    "   In Snowflake, performance issues may be due to factors such as improper warehouse sizing, inefficient query structure, or suboptimal data organization. If quick tuning (like increasing warehouse size) doesn’t help, we apply deeper query analysis similar to Oracle’s strategy.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Steps in the Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Query Modification\n",
    "   - **Why modify queries?** Snowflake’s optimizer doesn’t allow direct control like Oracle, but restructuring the query can still help. For example, reducing complex joins, subqueries, or window functions can lower resource demands.\n",
    "   - **How to modify:** Simplify the query or adjust its structure to optimize the execution plan.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Determine the Underlying Cause\n",
    "   - **Common Bottlenecks:** Look for high CPU utilization, excessive data scans, or frequent disk spills. Snowflake’s query profiler provides insight into which steps consume the most time and resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Core Analysis Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### a) Statistics and Parameters\n",
    "   - **Snowflake’s Approach to Statistics:** Unlike Oracle, Snowflake doesn’t require manual statistics collection; it manages statistics automatically. However, you can indirectly influence statistics by reorganizing data (clustering).\n",
    "   - **Parameters:** Snowflake’s key parameter is warehouse sizing. Larger warehouses provide more compute power but may not solve performance issues if the query is inefficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### b) Query Structure\n",
    "   - **Why analyze structure?** Complex joins, nested queries, and inefficient expressions increase Snowflake’s computation time. Rewriting or breaking down these structures can optimize performance.\n",
    "   - **What to do:** Avoid overly complex subqueries and use common table expressions (CTEs) sparingly to prevent excessive resource consumption.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### c) Access Paths\n",
    "   - **What are Access Paths in Snowflake?** Snowflake doesn’t offer direct control over access paths like Oracle, as it relies on its optimizer to select optimal paths based on data statistics. However, clustering keys and micro-partitioning affect how data is accessed.\n",
    "   - **Improving Access Paths:** Use clustering on frequently filtered columns to reduce data scans and improve access speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### d) Join Orders and Join Methods\n",
    "   - **Join Orders in Snowflake:** Snowflake’s optimizer automatically determines join orders based on its internal statistics, so there’s less manual control here than in Oracle.\n",
    "   - **Efficient Joins:** Choose smaller data sets to join first, use joins judiciously, and avoid Cartesian joins that can inflate processing costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Collection for Query Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### a) Execution Plan\n",
    "   - **Reading the Plan:** Snowflake provides a visual query profiler, detailing each step’s resource use (like CPU, memory, and I/O). This helps identify stages that consume excessive resources, like scan or join steps.\n",
    "   - **Focus on Costly Steps:** Identify which parts of the plan require the most compute time, focusing on high-resource steps (e.g., scans, joins).\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### b) Object Information & Statistics\n",
    "   - **Automatic Statistics:** Since Snowflake manages statistics automatically, focus on understanding which columns are frequently used in queries and consider clustering them.\n",
    "   - **Micro-Partitioning & Clustering:** Review clustering depth and micro-partition usage to ensure Snowflake optimizes data scans for your queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### c) Parameter Settings\n",
    "   - **Warehouse Size:** Ensure you’re using an appropriately sized warehouse, and consider auto-scaling options for dynamically adjusting resources based on demand.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pre-Analyze the Query**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Data Volume:** As with Oracle, check if the expected data volume aligns with the actual results. Large volumes in Snowflake could indicate inefficient filtering.\n",
    "   - **Predicate Review:** Ensure WHERE clauses filter effectively to limit the scanned data volume.\n",
    "   - **Problematic Constructs:** Be cautious with CTEs, window functions, and large IN lists, as these can increase resource usage.\n",
    "   - **Execution Plan Analysis:** Check:\n",
    "     - Excessive data scans\n",
    "     - High join or aggregation costs\n",
    "     - Disk spills (which indicate insufficient memory)\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Considering Query Tuning Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### Techniques to Improve Execution\n",
    "   - **Clustering on Key Columns:** Define clustering keys for high-cardinality columns frequently used in filters.\n",
    "   - **Warehouse Sizing:** Use larger warehouses for high-compute queries, especially those involving complex joins or aggregations.\n",
    "   - **Caching & Result Reuse:** Snowflake automatically caches results, so leverage this by re-running queries only when necessary.\n",
    "   - **Avoiding Resource Spills:** Reduce disk spills by ensuring adequate memory for complex operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Finding a Solution**\n",
    "   - After analyzing, apply Snowflake-specific techniques and re-check the query’s profiler for improvements."
