    "Let’s go step by step on how DML (Data Manipulation Language) is processed and committed in Oracle. I'll keep it simple and add some interview-ready insights where necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How DML is Processed and Committed in Oracle\n",
    "\n",
    "When you run a DML statement (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) in Oracle, the database server goes through several stages to process and commit the changes. Here's how it happens:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Check the Shared SQL Area for Similar Statements (Library Cache)**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** When a DML statement is issued, Oracle first checks the Shared SQL Area (part of the **Library Cache** within the Shared Pool) to see if a similar statement (same SQL structure) has already been executed.\n",
    "   - **Why?** This is done to reuse existing parsed SQL statements, saving processing time. If a match is found, Oracle can skip re-parsing the SQL.\n",
    "   - **Interview Tip:** Mention how Oracle optimizes resource usage by reusing parsed statements, improving performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Check Data Dictionary Cache (Row Cache) for Query Validation**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Next, Oracle checks the **Data Dictionary Cache** (or Row Cache) to validate the query. This cache holds metadata like table structure, column definitions, and user permissions.\n",
    "   - **Why?** The system ensures the query refers to valid objects (tables, columns, etc.) and verifies that the user has proper access rights to perform the operation.\n",
    "   - **Interview Tip:** Understanding query validation is crucial for ensuring secure and accurate data manipulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Check Buffer Cache and Undo Segments for Related Data**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Oracle then checks the **Buffer Cache** to find if the blocks of data affected by the DML are already in memory. If not, the data is loaded from disk. \n",
    "   - Simultaneously, Oracle checks **Undo Segments** (a special kind of storage) to keep a “before image” of the data, enabling rollback if needed.\n",
    "   - **Why?** The Undo Segments are vital to ensure consistency (especially in case of errors or rollbacks) and support the ACID properties of transactions.\n",
    "   - **Interview Tip:** Undo is essential in Oracle’s transaction management system, ensuring the ability to roll back changes if something goes wrong.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Lock the Related Data Blocks**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Oracle locks the relevant data blocks in the Buffer Cache to ensure consistency, preventing other transactions from modifying the same data simultaneously.\n",
    "   - **Why?** Locking prevents data corruption and maintains data integrity during the transaction.\n",
    "   - **Interview Tip:** Mention the importance of concurrency control and how Oracle uses locks to handle simultaneous DML operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) Make Changes to Blocks in the Buffer Cache**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Once locks are applied, Oracle makes the actual changes to the data blocks in the **Buffer Cache**, not on the disk yet.\n",
    "   - **Why?** These changes in memory ensure faster performance. They are eventually written to disk during a process called “Checkpoint.”\n",
    "   - **Interview Tip:** Stress how this step is about efficiency—Oracle uses memory to speed up changes while ensuring disk I/O is deferred for better performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6) The Server Returns Feedback**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** After making the changes in the buffer, Oracle returns feedback to the client (e.g., a message saying “X rows updated”).\n",
    "   - **Why?** This confirms the DML execution has been successfully processed, though the changes may not yet be on disk.\n",
    "   - **Interview Tip:** Understand that feedback is given for client communication, but the data is only persisted when committed.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How **Commit** Happens in Oracle\n",
    "\n",
    "After DML execution, a **COMMIT** ensures that the changes are made permanent. Here’s what happens during a commit:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write to Redo Log**: Before changes are committed, Oracle writes the transaction details into the **Redo Log Buffer** (in memory). This log is eventually flushed to the Redo Log Files on disk.\n",
    "2. **Undo Segment Changes**: The “before image” in the Undo Segments is finalized, marking that it can no longer be rolled back.\n",
    "3. **Commit Confirmation**: Oracle sends a confirmation to the client that the transaction is committed, and it guarantees durability."
