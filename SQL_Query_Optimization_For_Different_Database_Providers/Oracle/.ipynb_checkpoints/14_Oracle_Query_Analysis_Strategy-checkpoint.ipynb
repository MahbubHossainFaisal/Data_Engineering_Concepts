    "### Query Analysis Strategy for Oracle\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When to Use This Strategy**  \n",
    "   If quick tuning adjustments (like adding indexes or rewriting queries) haven’t improved performance and we have time to investigate, Oracle’s query analysis strategy is ideal. This strategy focuses on analyzing and tuning the query to address performance bottlenecks at a deeper level.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Steps in the Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Query Modification\n",
    "   - **Why modify queries?** Some queries can be tuned simply by restructuring them, which may help Oracle’s optimizer make better choices for execution.\n",
    "   - **How to modify:** This might mean simplifying subqueries, breaking complex queries into smaller parts, or changing query constructs that can cause performance issues (e.g., using JOINs instead of subqueries).\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Determine the Underlying Cause\n",
    "   - **What’s the purpose?** Before changing anything, understand why the query isn’t performing well. This is a combination of collecting execution plans, understanding object statistics, and examining how data is accessed and joined.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Core Analysis Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### a) Statistics and Parameters\n",
    "   - **Importance of Statistics:** Up-to-date statistics on tables and indexes help Oracle’s optimizer estimate the best execution plan. We should check both object statistics (like tables and indexes) and system statistics (CPU, I/O).\n",
    "   - **Parameters:** Ensure key optimizer parameters are set correctly (e.g., `optimizer_mode`, `optimizer_index_cost_adj`). Incorrect settings may lead to suboptimal plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### b) Query Structure\n",
    "   - **Why analyze structure?** Complex constructs (such as unnecessary subqueries or overuse of `OR` conditions) can slow down execution.\n",
    "   - **What to do:** Identify constructs like outer joins, nested subqueries, or excessive OR conditions that could be simplified.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### c) Access Paths\n",
    "   - **What are Access Paths?** These define how data is retrieved from storage, like full table scans or index lookups. Choosing the right path is critical for performance.\n",
    "   - **Tuning Access Paths:** Consider using indexes, or create an index-organized table (IOT) if you access data through a specific set of columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### d) Join Orders and Join Methods\n",
    "   - **Join Orders:** The order in which tables are joined can impact performance. Oracle usually decides based on its statistics but may not always pick the best order.\n",
    "   - **Join Methods:** Oracle uses several join methods (e.g., nested loops, hash joins). Choosing the right one is essential for performance, particularly in large datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Collection for Query Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### a) Execution Plan\n",
    "   - **Reading the Plan:** Oracle provides an execution plan that shows step-by-step data retrieval. Key points are access paths, join methods, and estimated vs. actual row counts.\n",
    "   - **Identify Costly Steps:** Compare the actual and estimated rows in the execution plan, focusing on areas where logical reads or costs are unexpectedly high.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### b) Object Information & Statistics\n",
    "   - **Why Collect Stats?** Accurate object statistics allow the optimizer to choose efficient execution paths. Check both object-specific stats (tables and indexes) and system-level statistics.\n",
    "   - **Histograms:** Histograms give Oracle more granular info about data distribution, helpful for skewed data in indexed columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### c) Parameter Settings\n",
    "   - **Parameter Checks:** Ensure that critical parameters are tuned correctly. For example, settings like `OPTIMIZER_DYNAMIC_SAMPLING` or `OPTIMIZER_INDEX_CACHING` can impact performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pre-Analyze the Query**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Volume of Data:** Ensure the expected data volume aligns with actual results; an unexpected volume can indicate a poor join or where clause.\n",
    "   - **Predicate Review:** Review query predicates (WHERE clauses) to verify they’re filtering data correctly and avoiding unnecessary data.\n",
    "   - **Problematic Constructs:** Complex constructs like outer joins, IN or OR lists, and views can cause inefficiencies.\n",
    "   - **Execution Plan Analysis:** Look for:\n",
    "     - Access paths\n",
    "     - Join orders and types\n",
    "     - Discrepancies between estimated and actual rows\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Considering Query Tuning Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### Techniques to Improve Execution\n",
    "   - **Update Statistics:** Ensuring statistics are current allows the optimizer to make better decisions.\n",
    "   - **Dynamic Statistics:** Enable if dynamic data sampling can improve performance.\n",
    "   - **Indexes:** Consider creating indexes on frequently accessed columns or recreating existing ones if data patterns have changed.\n",
    "   - **Hints:** Use Oracle’s hints (like `INDEX` or `LEADING`) to influence the optimizer’s decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Finding a Solution**\n",
    "   - After the analysis, apply a combination of the above techniques and re-check the query’s execution plan to verify improvements."
