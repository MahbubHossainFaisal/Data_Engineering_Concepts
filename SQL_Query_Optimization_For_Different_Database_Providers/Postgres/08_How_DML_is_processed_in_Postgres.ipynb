    "Let’s now look at how DML (Data Manipulation Language) is processed and committed in **PostgreSQL**. PostgreSQL is an advanced open-source relational database, and its architecture differs slightly from Oracle and SQL Server in how it handles transactions, caching, and committing changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How DML is Processed and Committed in PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "When a DML statement (like `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`) is executed in PostgreSQL, the system processes it in the following way:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Parse and Check for Reusable Query Plans (Query Cache)**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** When a DML statement is executed, PostgreSQL parses the query and checks the **execution plan cache** for a similar query. If a reusable execution plan is available, it skips the parsing and planning phases, directly reusing the cached plan.\n",
    "   - **Why?** Reusing query plans helps save time by avoiding the overhead of query planning for similar SQL statements.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** While Oracle checks the Shared SQL Area for similar statements, PostgreSQL uses a **plan cache** to store query execution plans. However, by default, PostgreSQL does not store the actual results like Snowflake's result cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Validate the Query Using System Catalog**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** PostgreSQL checks the **System Catalog** (similar to Oracle’s Data Dictionary Cache) to validate the DML statement. It verifies the structure of the query, checks if the objects (tables, columns, etc.) exist, and ensures the user has appropriate permissions.\n",
    "   - **Why?** This step guarantees that the query operates on valid and authorized database objects.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** Like Oracle, PostgreSQL performs this validation through its metadata catalog, but it tightly integrates with its query optimizer to make informed decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Check for Cached Data in Shared Buffers and Apply Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** PostgreSQL checks its **Shared Buffers** (similar to Oracle’s Buffer Cache) for the data pages required by the DML operation. If the required data is already in memory, it works directly on those pages. Otherwise, it loads the data from disk into memory. \n",
    "   - It also writes to its **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** to ensure durability. The WAL keeps a record of every change before the actual data pages are modified.\n",
    "   - **Why?** The Shared Buffers improve read/write performance by keeping data in memory, while the WAL ensures crash recovery and durability.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** PostgreSQL’s **WAL** is equivalent to Oracle’s **Redo Logs**, but PostgreSQL uses WAL more directly for transaction recovery and ensuring durability before committing changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Apply Locks on the Required Rows or Pages**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** PostgreSQL applies **row-level** locks (or **table-level** locks in some cases) to the affected data. This ensures that no other transaction can modify the same rows until the current transaction is completed or rolled back.\n",
    "   - **Why?** Locking ensures that data integrity is maintained in concurrent transaction scenarios.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** PostgreSQL primarily uses **row-level** locks, similar to SQL Server’s locking mechanism. Oracle typically locks data at the block level but can also use row-level locks.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) Modify Data in Shared Buffers (In-Memory Changes)**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Once the locks are in place, PostgreSQL modifies the data in the **Shared Buffers**. These changes are made in memory, and the actual disk write happens later.\n",
    "   - The changes are also logged in the **WAL**, ensuring that if a crash occurs before the data is written to disk, the changes can be recovered from the WAL.\n",
    "   - **Why?** Modifying data in memory first improves performance, as direct disk I/O is more expensive. The WAL ensures data durability and crash recovery.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** Oracle uses **Redo Logs** to store before and after images of changes, while PostgreSQL logs only enough information in its WAL to replay the changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6) Return Feedback to the Client**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** After making the changes in memory, PostgreSQL provides feedback to the client. This feedback informs the user or application about the number of affected rows or any errors encountered.\n",
    "   - **Why?** This gives immediate confirmation of query execution, although the changes are still in memory and not yet committed to disk.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** Like Oracle, PostgreSQL provides feedback at this stage. Both systems defer the actual disk write until a commit occurs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How **Commit** Happens in PostgreSQL\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Flush WAL to Disk**: When a transaction is committed, PostgreSQL ensures that all changes recorded in the **WAL** (Write-Ahead Log) are written to disk. This is crucial for ensuring data durability and crash recovery.\n",
    "   - **Why?** The WAL serves as the main mechanism for data durability. PostgreSQL ensures the WAL is persisted before confirming a commit.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Flush Modified Data from Shared Buffers to Disk**: PostgreSQL does not immediately flush data from the **Shared Buffers** to disk when a commit occurs. Instead, the data is written to disk during periodic **checkpoints**. The WAL provides the durability guarantee, while the Shared Buffers improve performance.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle:** Similar to Oracle's **Buffer Cache**, PostgreSQL’s Shared Buffers hold the modified data until a **checkpoint** occurs. Oracle also uses checkpoints to flush dirty data blocks from memory to disk.\n",
    "   \n",
    "3. **Release Locks**: Once the transaction is committed, PostgreSQL releases the locks that were applied to the data, allowing other transactions to access the modified data.\n",
    "   \n",
    "4. **Ensure Crash Recovery**: If PostgreSQL crashes before the modified data is written to disk, the **WAL** can be replayed during recovery to ensure that committed transactions are not lost.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences from Oracle\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write-Ahead Logging (WAL) vs. Redo Logs**: PostgreSQL uses the **WAL** for transaction durability and crash recovery, while Oracle uses **Redo Logs** for a similar purpose. However, WAL is more tightly integrated into PostgreSQL’s core transaction handling.\n",
    "  \n",
    "- **Buffer Cache vs. Shared Buffers**: Both Oracle and PostgreSQL use an in-memory buffer (Buffer Cache in Oracle, Shared Buffers in PostgreSQL) to store modified data before it’s written to disk. However, PostgreSQL doesn’t flush this data immediately after a commit; instead, it relies on periodic checkpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Row-Level Locking**: Like SQL Server, PostgreSQL primarily uses **row-level locks** during DML operations. Oracle often locks data at the block level, which can have different performance implications.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Commit and WAL Flushing**: PostgreSQL ensures that the **WAL** is flushed to disk before confirming a commit, but the actual data may not be written until later checkpoints. In Oracle, the **Redo Log** is similarly written during commits, and data pages are written at checkpoints.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In PostgreSQL, DML processing involves:\n",
    "- Using a **plan cache** to avoid redundant query parsing.\n",
    "- Validating the query via the **System Catalog**.\n",
    "- Modifying data in memory (Shared Buffers) and recording changes in the **WAL** for durability.\n",
    "- Committing by flushing the **WAL** to disk and handling actual data writes later during a checkpoint."
