    "### Query Analysis Strategy for PostgreSQL (Postgres)\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When to Use This Strategy**  \n",
    "   In PostgreSQL, if basic optimization steps like adding indexes or optimizing parameters haven’t improved performance, we use a deeper query analysis. PostgreSQL’s query tuning relies on understanding query structures, tuning indexing, and carefully examining execution plans.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Steps in the Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Query Modification\n",
    "   - **Why Modify Queries?** Like in Oracle, Snowflake, and MSSQL, query modifications in PostgreSQL can help the optimizer choose better plans. For instance, simplifying complex joins or using CTEs more effectively can reduce resource use.\n",
    "   - **How to Modify:** Remove subqueries that could be combined as joins, limit data fetched by narrowing columns and rows, and avoid redundant operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Determine the Underlying Cause\n",
    "   - **Common Bottlenecks:** PostgreSQL performance issues often stem from sequential scans, inefficient joins, or inadequate indexing. Use tools like `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to identify which query parts consume the most resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Core Analysis Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### a) Statistics and Parameters\n",
    "   - **Importance of Statistics:** PostgreSQL requires accurate table and column statistics for the optimizer. These statistics influence join orders, filtering, and access paths.\n",
    "   - **Parameter Tuning:** Key parameters include `work_mem` (memory for operations like sorts and hashes), `effective_cache_size` (guiding optimizer memory estimates), and `random_page_cost` (cost of disk access). These settings impact query plans and execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### b) Query Structure\n",
    "   - **Why Analyze Structure?** Complex queries increase PostgreSQL’s processing time, especially when they involve inefficient joins or nested constructs.\n",
    "   - **What to Do:** Use indexes where appropriate, simplify joins, and avoid redundant computations. PostgreSQL allows flexible join planning, but efficient query structure aids its optimizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### c) Access Paths\n",
    "   - **Access Paths in PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL primarily uses sequential scans, index scans, and bitmap scans. Controlling access paths is done by creating and maintaining indexes, and through parameter tuning.\n",
    "   - **Optimizing Access Paths:** To improve path efficiency, consider composite indexes, partial indexes, and creating indexes on frequently used filtered columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### d) Join Orders and Join Methods\n",
    "   - **Join Orders in PostgreSQL:** PostgreSQL’s optimizer automatically chooses join orders, which you can indirectly control by providing the optimizer with accurate statistics and indexing.\n",
    "   - **Join Methods:** PostgreSQL supports nested loop joins, hash joins, and merge joins, each suitable for different scenarios. Using the right join type for query structure (like hash joins for large tables) helps reduce resource use.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Collection for Query Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### a) Execution Plan\n",
    "   - **Reading the Plan:** Use `EXPLAIN` or `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` to see the execution plan, which shows access paths, join types, and estimated vs. actual row counts. Pay attention to sequential scans or sort operations that indicate potential for optimization.\n",
    "   - **Identify Costly Steps:** Look for high-cost sequential scans, joins, and sort operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### b) Object Information & Statistics\n",
    "   - **Statistics Collection:** Ensure regular updates on column statistics using `ANALYZE` or automatic updates. Also, review statistics on frequently queried columns for any gaps.\n",
    "   - **Histograms & Data Skew:** PostgreSQL creates histograms for data distribution, which helps the optimizer choose better plans, especially for selective queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### c) Parameter Settings\n",
    "   - **Parameter Checks:** Confirm that settings like `work_mem`, `effective_cache_size`, and `maintenance_work_mem` align with the query’s needs, as they impact sort and join performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pre-Analyze the Query**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Data Volume Check:** Ensure the expected data volume matches the actual results. Large results might indicate inefficient filtering.\n",
    "   - **Predicate Review:** Ensure WHERE clauses are specific, indexed, and don’t force sequential scans.\n",
    "   - **Problematic Constructs:** Be cautious with nested CTEs, large IN lists, and OR conditions, which can be rewritten to optimize processing.\n",
    "   - **Execution Plan Analysis:** Look for:\n",
    "     - Costly sequential scans or joins\n",
    "     - Discrepancies in estimated vs. actual rows\n",
    "     - Expensive sort or hash operations\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Considering Query Tuning Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### Techniques to Improve Execution\n",
    "   - **Update Statistics:** Use `ANALYZE` to keep statistics current on key tables and columns.\n",
    "   - **Indexing:** PostgreSQL supports partial indexes, unique indexes, and covering indexes, which can speed up queries by providing direct access paths.\n",
    "   - **Query Hints via Configuration:** Although PostgreSQL doesn’t have direct hints, you can guide the optimizer with parameter settings and query structure.\n",
    "   - **Partitioning:** Partition large tables by date or other logical divisions to improve read efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Finding a Solution**\n",
    "   - Re-evaluate using `EXPLAIN ANALYZE` after implementing changes to confirm improvements and validate estimated costs.\n"
