    "### Firebolt Query Optimization Model\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **No Explicit \"Cost\" Formula**\n",
    "   - Firebolt doesn’t use an explicit cost-based optimizer as seen in traditional databases like Oracle or MSSQL. Instead, it leverages **cloud-native design elements**, including advanced indexing and efficient data storage, to ensure fast execution, especially for analytical queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Key Components for Query Optimization**\n",
    "   - **Data Pruning via Indexed Tables**: Firebolt primarily uses two types of indexes: **Primary Indexes** and **Aggregating Indexes**.\n",
    "     - **Primary Indexes**: These are used to organize data in a sorted and compressed format, enabling Firebolt to prune out irrelevant data during query execution. This minimizes the number of rows scanned, reducing I/O operations and improving query speed.\n",
    "     - **Aggregating Indexes**: Designed to store pre-aggregated values, Aggregating Indexes allow Firebolt to avoid recalculating aggregates, which is especially useful for large datasets. These indexes reduce the need for additional CPU processing, making queries faster and more resource-efficient.\n",
    "   - **Data Caching**: Firebolt caches frequently accessed data to reduce the number of disk I/O operations required for recurring queries. This caching takes place in memory, minimizing latency for repeated queries.\n",
    "   - **Distributed Query Execution**: Firebolt’s cloud-native architecture allows it to leverage distributed query execution, spreading workloads across multiple compute nodes. This approach reduces both I/O and CPU bottlenecks by allowing parallel processing, particularly for complex analytical queries.\n",
    "   - **Auto-Scaling Compute Clusters**: Firebolt uses clusters that can scale up or down based on workload demand. This adaptive scaling reduces CPU load for high-volume queries, optimizing performance without manual intervention.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Execution Model in Firebolt**\n",
    "   - **Query Compilation and Optimization**: Firebolt compiles and optimizes queries using metadata from indexes to avoid scanning unnecessary data. This metadata-driven approach is key to optimizing performance without traditional cost-based calculations.\n",
    "   - **Indexing as a Core Optimization Strategy**: Firebolt’s heavy reliance on Primary and Aggregating Indexes allows it to handle large datasets without requiring complex, multi-stage cost calculations. Instead, the optimizer narrows down query results directly from index structures, which is especially effective for analytics.\n",
    "\n",

    "### Interview-Ready Points\n",
    "- **Index-Driven Optimization**: Firebolt doesn’t rely on a cost formula but uses its unique Primary and Aggregating Indexes to prune data and reduce I/O, making queries faster.\n",
    "- **Distributed and Scalable**: Unlike traditional databases, Firebolt is built for distributed and parallel processing with auto-scaling capabilities, enhancing CPU and memory efficiency.\n",
    "- **Cloud-Native, Analytics-Focused**: Firebolt’s architecture prioritizes efficient handling of analytical queries by focusing on cloud-native designs rather than traditional cost-based optimization."
