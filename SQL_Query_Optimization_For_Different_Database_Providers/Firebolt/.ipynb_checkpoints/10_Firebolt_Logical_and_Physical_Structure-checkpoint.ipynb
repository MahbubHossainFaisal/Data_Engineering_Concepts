    "### Firebolt Logical and Physical Database Structure\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Data Blocks (Similar to Oracle Blocks)\n",
    "   - **Data Blocks**: In Firebolt, data is stored in compressed, immutable blocks, which are the smallest storage units, somewhat comparable to Oracle’s blocks.\n",
    "   - **Size**: Data blocks are stored in columnar format and compressed for efficiency, with sizes varying based on the amount of data and compression.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Data blocks allow Firebolt to store data efficiently, with a focus on read optimization for fast analytics queries. They are optimized for analytical queries rather than frequent updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Storage Units (Concept Similar to Extents)\n",
    "   - **Storage Units**: While Firebolt does not have extents explicitly, its columnar storage approach aggregates data blocks into manageable chunks, similar to how extents aggregate blocks.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: These storage units manage large datasets, allowing quick access to compressed data in analytical queries and providing efficient memory usage across different queries.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. Tables (Equivalent to Segments)\n",
    "   - **Tables**: Firebolt tables are logical containers for organizing data. The storage engine uses tables as a unit for managing data at scale, similar to segments in Oracle.\n",
    "   - **Types of Tables**:\n",
    "      - **Fact Tables**: For storing large volumes of transactional or event data.\n",
    "      - **Dimension Tables**: For smaller, descriptive data that supports analytics.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Tables organize data in Firebolt and are optimized for analytical workloads through columnar storage and data indexing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Workspaces (Alternative to Tablespaces)\n",
    "   - **Workspaces**: Firebolt uses workspaces to logically group compute resources (data warehouses) instead of purely storage. However, these workspaces organize resources and connect them to specific databases or tables.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Workspaces allow you to assign compute resources to specific workloads, similar to how tablespaces logically organize storage in Oracle. They facilitate efficient query processing by grouping compute resources for data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. Database\n",
    "   - **Database**: In Firebolt, a database is a logical container that groups tables and views, similar to Oracle databases.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Databases provide logical separation of data and serve as containers to organize tables and other objects, supporting multi-tenancy and resource management.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. Schema\n",
    "   - **Schema**: Schemas within Firebolt databases help organize tables, views, and other objects. Unlike some traditional databases, schemas are mostly organizational rather than a namespace for permissions.\n",
    "   - **Purpose**: Schemas provide a structure within the database, separating objects by context or purpose, facilitating data organization and query efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences in Firebolt\n",
    "   - **Columnar Storage and Compression**: Firebolt’s columnar format differs significantly from row-based databases, enabling high-performance analytics by storing each column separately and compressing data.\n",
    "   - **Indexing and Indexing Methods**: Firebolt uses advanced indexing, including sparse indexes, to accelerate query performance, instead of traditional row-based indexing found in transactional databases.\n",
    "   - **No Dedicated Undo Segments or Temporary Tablespaces**: Firebolt’s immutable storage design reduces the need for undo segments or temporary tablespaces. Data writes are handled in bulk, with modifications applied through new data blocks rather than in-place updates."
