    "Firebolt is a cloud-based data warehouse that specializes in high-performance analytics, especially for massive datasets. It’s designed for fast querying and works with columnar storage and advanced indexing techniques. Its DML (Data Manipulation Language) operations and the commit process have some differences compared to traditional databases like Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How DML is Processed and Committed in **Firebolt**\n",
    "\n",
    "Firebolt uses a distributed architecture, and the process of handling DML is highly optimized for real-time analytics. Let's walk through the typical steps that happen when DML is processed in Firebolt:\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "**1) Query Parsing and Optimization**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** When a DML statement is issued (such as `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `DELETE`), Firebolt parses the query and generates an optimized execution plan. This plan considers the structure of the data, the indexes involved, and the distribution of data across nodes in the cluster.\n",
    "   - **Why?** Efficient query execution is crucial for fast analytics. Firebolt uses **cost-based query optimization** to ensure that the plan runs as quickly as possible.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle/PostgreSQL:** Firebolt’s query optimizer is specifically designed for columnar storage and distributed processing, which differs from traditional row-based storage optimizers like those found in Oracle or PostgreSQL.\n",
    "\n",
    "**2) Check Metadata and Data Cache**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Firebolt checks its **metadata** to validate the DML statement. It ensures that the query is valid, checks if the required tables and columns exist, and ensures that the user has the necessary permissions. It also checks **data cache** to see if any part of the data that the query needs is already in memory.\n",
    "   - **Why?** This step ensures the validity of the query and improves performance by reusing cached data where possible.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle/PostgreSQL:** Firebolt’s use of metadata is similar, but it also takes advantage of its unique **aggregated index** and **join index** structures to quickly locate the necessary data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**3) Apply Locks for Data Integrity**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Firebolt applies locks at the **table level** to ensure data consistency during the DML operation. Since Firebolt is an analytics-focused database, DML operations like `UPDATE` or `DELETE` are less frequent, but when they occur, the system applies necessary locks to maintain integrity.\n",
    "   - **Why?** Even in analytics databases, ensuring that no other operation interferes with an ongoing DML change is essential for data correctness.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle/PostgreSQL:** Firebolt's locking is typically done at a higher level (like tables) due to the nature of its batch-oriented processing, unlike row-level locks in PostgreSQL and Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4) Modify Data in Columnar Format (Write to Indexes)**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Firebolt stores data in **columnar** format, which is highly optimized for read-heavy workloads. When DML operations modify data, the changes are applied to the **indexes** (like primary indexes, aggregated indexes, and join indexes) and stored in **micro-partitions**.\n",
    "   - **Why?** This structure allows Firebolt to provide blazing-fast read performance for analytical queries, even on massive datasets.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle/PostgreSQL:** Traditional databases use row-based storage. Firebolt’s columnar storage ensures that modifications happen at the column level, which is more efficient for analytics workloads.\n",
    "\n",
    "**5) Distributed Data Modification and Coordination**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Since Firebolt is a distributed system, the DML operation must modify data across multiple nodes or shards in the cluster. Firebolt’s distributed architecture ensures that these modifications happen efficiently and consistently across the system.\n",
    "   - **Why?** In a distributed environment, data is often partitioned across multiple machines. Firebolt ensures that the DML changes are coordinated across these partitions for consistency and fault tolerance.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle/PostgreSQL:** Firebolt's distributed nature requires specialized handling of DML, which is different from centralized databases like Oracle or PostgreSQL that don’t need to coordinate changes across multiple nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "**6) Commit Operation with Write-Ahead Logging (WAL)**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** Firebolt uses a **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** to record the changes made during the DML operation. Once the changes are logged, Firebolt confirms the transaction as committed.\n",
    "   - **Why?** WAL ensures durability in case of system failure. It allows the system to recover the changes even if the actual data has not yet been written to the underlying storage.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle/PostgreSQL:** Firebolt’s WAL is conceptually similar to PostgreSQL’s and Oracle’s redo logs. However, Firebolt’s WAL is optimized for distributed, columnar storage, ensuring that changes can be replayed across the cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "**7) Propagation of Changes and Data Compaction**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** After the DML operation is committed, Firebolt propagates the changes to the data files stored in cloud storage. This process often involves **data compaction**, where multiple small files (resulting from frequent updates) are compacted into larger files to optimize storage and query performance.\n",
    "   - **Why?** Data compaction is necessary to prevent performance degradation from too many small files, which can occur when frequent DML operations happen.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle/PostgreSQL:** Firebolt's cloud-based architecture requires efficient management of data files in cloud storage. This is different from on-premises databases like Oracle, which manage data files locally.\n",
    "\n",
    "**8) Feedback to Client**\n",
    "   - **Explanation:** After the changes are applied and logged, Firebolt provides feedback to the client, indicating the success of the operation or any errors that may have occurred.\n",
    "   - **Why?** This step is essential for client applications to know whether the operation was successful or not.\n",
    "   - **Difference from Oracle/PostgreSQL:** Similar to other databases, Firebolt returns feedback at this point, although the processing may be faster due to its architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### How **Commit** Happens in Firebolt\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Write Changes to WAL**: Like other databases, Firebolt first ensures that all changes are written to its **Write-Ahead Log (WAL)** before committing the transaction. This ensures durability and crash recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distribute Changes Across Nodes**: Firebolt distributes the changes across the nodes in the cluster, ensuring consistency across its distributed architecture.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Propagation and Compaction**: Once the WAL is written, Firebolt propagates the changes to its underlying cloud storage. Firebolt’s compaction processes ensure that the data files remain optimized for querying after the DML operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Release Locks**: After the transaction is committed, Firebolt releases any locks applied during the DML process, allowing other queries to access the modified data.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Checkpointing**: Firebolt periodically performs **checkpoints**, similar to other databases, to ensure that modified data is written to disk and that the system can recover from any crashes.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Differences from Other Databases\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Columnar Storage**: Firebolt’s columnar format and indexing system make it fundamentally different from row-based systems like Oracle or PostgreSQL. This makes it extremely efficient for analytical queries but also means its DML handling is optimized for batch-like updates rather than frequent transactional changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Distributed Architecture**: Unlike Oracle or PostgreSQL, Firebolt’s distributed architecture means that DML changes must be coordinated across multiple nodes, which adds complexity but also provides scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Cloud-Native Features**: Firebolt is designed for cloud environments and uses cloud storage for data persistence. It also leverages cloud-native features like data compaction, which are not relevant in on-premise databases like Oracle.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **DML in Analytical Workloads**: Firebolt is primarily optimized for analytical workloads where **read performance** is more critical than frequent DML operations. However, it still supports efficient DML handling through its distributed, columnar architecture.\n"
