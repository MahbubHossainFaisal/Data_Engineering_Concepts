    "### Query Analysis Strategy for Firebolt\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **When to Use This Strategy**  \n",
    "   Firebolt’s unique architecture focuses on analytics and fast data querying. We apply query analysis in Firebolt when standard quick fixes, like using aggregated indexes, don’t work as expected. With Firebolt, query tuning is highly effective when done by optimizing access paths, data formats, and execution plans due to its columnar storage and unique indexing features.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Steps in the Strategy**\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Query Modification\n",
    "   - **Why Modify Queries?** Firebolt optimizes for columnar data and big data analytics; some query structures, however, may need tweaking to perform optimally.\n",
    "   - **How to Modify:** Rewrite nested subqueries and complex joins to leverage Firebolt’s indexing features. Filtering early in the query and aligning predicates with indexed columns helps improve performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "   #### Determine the Underlying Cause\n",
    "   - **Common Bottlenecks:** In Firebolt, issues like high data scan volumes, non-aggregated indexes, or improper join usage can slow down performance. Firebolt’s cloud-first architecture means efficient use of resources and indexes are critical to minimizing costs and improving speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Core Analysis Steps**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### a) Statistics and Parameters\n",
    "   - **Importance of Statistics:** Firebolt leverages real-time statistics on data usage, with optimizations for columnar reads. Ensure that frequently queried columns have aggregated indexes or are partitioned logically.\n",
    "   - **Parameter Tuning:** Firebolt’s configuration is managed through cluster scaling and node optimization, with minimal manual tuning needed. Instead, efficient usage of clusters and memory resources is key to managing workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### b) Query Structure\n",
    "   - **Why Analyze Structure?** Analyzing query structure ensures Firebolt’s storage and compute separation is used effectively. Complex joins and non-optimized aggregates can lead to increased resource consumption.\n",
    "   - **What to Do:** Simplify joins, use window functions with caution, and rewrite aggregations to match Firebolt’s storage patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### c) Access Paths\n",
    "   - **Access Paths in Firebolt:** Firebolt uses advanced indexing (Aggregated, Join, and Sparse indexes) as its primary access path tools.\n",
    "   - **Optimizing Access Paths:** Choosing the correct index type can drastically improve query speed; for example, use Join indexes for frequently joined columns and Sparse indexes for low-cardinality columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### d) Join Orders and Join Methods\n",
    "   - **Join Orders in Firebolt:** Proper join order and the use of Join indexes are important to control data scanned during joins.\n",
    "   - **Join Methods:** Firebolt’s Join indexes optimize join operations, but correct ordering and using matching index types are essential for quick retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Data Collection for Query Analysis**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### a) Execution Plan\n",
    "   - **Reading the Plan:** Use Firebolt’s `EXPLAIN` function to analyze execution plans, which show access paths, join order, and cost estimates.\n",
    "   - **Identify Costly Steps:** Focus on high-cost joins and scans; identify if certain tables lack Join or Aggregated indexes.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### b) Object Information & Statistics\n",
    "   - **Index Coverage and Statistics:** Ensure indexes are aligned with query patterns. Firebolt offers tools to assess index performance and track common queries for indexing.\n",
    "   - **Partitioning and Distribution:** For very large tables, partitioning optimizes read speeds and minimizes unnecessary data scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### c) Parameter Settings\n",
    "   - **Cluster and Node Configuration:** Use appropriately sized clusters for query loads; adjust for concurrency and use a mix of storage-optimized and compute-optimized nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Pre-Analyze the Query**\n",
    "\n",
    "   - **Data Volume Check:** Check that the data returned aligns with expectations, as high volumes may require indexing adjustments.\n",
    "   - **Predicate Review:** Ensure filters and WHERE clauses target indexed columns or aggregated indexes.\n",
    "   - **Problematic Constructs:** Complex joins, window functions, or unindexed columns can slow down queries in Firebolt.\n",
    "   - **Execution Plan Analysis:** Look for:\n",
    "     - Sequential scans on large tables\n",
    "     - Expensive joins not using Join indexes\n",
    "     - Excessive scan costs compared to index usage\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Considering Query Tuning Techniques**\n",
    "\n",
    "   ##### Techniques to Improve Execution\n",
    "   - **Indexing:** Firebolt supports multiple index types to improve query performance based on access patterns.\n",
    "   - **Optimized Storage Formats:** Firebolt’s compressed storage is highly performant for read-heavy workloads. Ensuring data formats align with query patterns is crucial.\n",
    "   - **Cluster Scaling:** For resource-intensive queries, scaling clusters (vertically or horizontally) can reduce processing time.\n",
    "   - **Partitioning:** Logical partitioning of tables allows Firebolt to process data more selectively, reducing query time.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. **Finding a Solution**\n",
    "   - Re-run queries after implementing changes, using `EXPLAIN` to verify reductions in cost and scanned data."
