    "After you’ve achieved **2NF**, your data no longer has **partial dependencies**.\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧠 **1. What does 3NF aim to achieve?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "3NF eliminates **transitive dependencies** — where a non-key column depends on another non-key column instead of directly on the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔍 **2. What is a transitive dependency?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A **transitive dependency** occurs when:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Primary Key → Column A → Column B\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, Column B depends indirectly on the Primary Key through another non-key column.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**\n",
    "player_id → skill_level → player_rating\n",
    "→ `player_rating` indirectly depends on player_id → violates 3NF.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧱 **3. What are the requirements for a table to be in 3NF?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The table must already be in **2NF**.\n",
    "2. No **transitive dependency** — every non-key column must depend only on the primary key.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚙️ **4. How to fix a table that violates 3NF?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "👉 **Decompose** the table:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Move the indirectly dependent attribute to a new table.\n",
    "* Establish a **foreign key** relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 **5. What anomalies does 3NF help prevent?**\n",
    "\n",
    "| Anomaly Type          | Example                                                          |\n",
    "| --------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |\n",
    "| **Update Anomaly**    | Changing “Beginner” to “Rookie” requires updating multiple rows. |\n",
    "| **Insertion Anomaly** | You can’t add a new skill level unless a player exists.          |\n",

    "\n",
    "### 🧩 **7. Can a table be in 2NF but not in 3NF?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "✅ Yes.\n",
    "A table can have **no partial dependency** (so it’s in 2NF) but still have **transitive dependency**, breaking 3NF.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "`player_id → skill_level → player_rating`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧱 **8. Can a table with only one non-key attribute violate 3NF?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "❌ No.\n",
    "If there’s only one non-key column, it can only depend on the primary key — not another non-key.\n",
    "Hence, it’s automatically in 3NF.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ⚖️ **9. Why is 3NF crucial for real-world databases?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Because it ensures:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Data consistency**\n",
    "* **Minimal redundancy**\n",
    "* **Simpler updates and inserts**\n",
    "* **Reliable referential integrity**\n",
    "\n",
    "In real systems (like players, customers, or products), 3NF forms the **base structure** before further optimization or denormalization for performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🚀 **10. What’s next after 3NF?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Next comes **Boyce-Codd Normal Form (BCNF)**, a stricter version of 3NF.\n",
    "It handles certain cases where 3NF rules pass but anomalies can still exist due to **multiple candidate keys**.\n",
