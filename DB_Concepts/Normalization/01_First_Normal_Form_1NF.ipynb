    "### 🧠 **1. What is the main goal of Second Normal Form (2NF)?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "The main goal of 2NF is to **eliminate partial dependency**, meaning every non-key attribute should depend on the **whole primary key**, not just part of it.\n",
    "This ensures better **data integrity** and **reduces redundancy**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🧩 **2. What is Partial Dependency?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A **partial dependency** occurs when a **non-key column** depends on only **part of a composite primary key**, instead of the entire key.\n",
    "👉 If your primary key is made up of **two or more columns**, and a non-key column depends on just one of them — that’s a **partial dependency**.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "❌ **No.**\n",
    "Because **partial dependency** can only exist when there’s a **composite primary key**.\n",

    "### 💡 **7. How does 2NF improve data safety compared to 1NF?**\n",

    "In 1NF, partial dependencies can cause **data duplication** and **inconsistent updates**.\n",
    "2NF eliminates those issues, ensuring:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Updates are consistent\n",
    "* Deletions don’t remove unrelated data\n",
