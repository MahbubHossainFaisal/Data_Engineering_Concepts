    "### 🔹 **1. What is the main goal of 5NF?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "To eliminate **join dependencies** — ensuring that a table cannot be decomposed into smaller tables without losing information or creating false combinations when joined back.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **2. What is a join dependency?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "When a table can be **reconstructed** from two or more smaller tables via joins,\n",
    "but the joins also generate **extra (spurious)** rows —\n",
    "that indicates a **join dependency**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **3. Can a table be in 4NF but not in 5NF?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "✅ Yes.\n",
    "A table in 4NF can still have **complex join dependencies** that lead to spurious tuples when recombined.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **4. What is a spurious tuple?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "A **false or duplicate row** that appears after joining decomposed tables —\n",
    "one that didn’t exist in the original relation.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔹 **5. How is 5NF achieved?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "By decomposing tables into the **smallest meaningful relations** so that every join dependency is implied by the **candidate keys**.\n",

    "### 🔹 **7. Is 5NF commonly used in practice?**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Answer:**\n",
    "Not very often — because most real-world databases stop at **3NF or 4NF**.\n",
    "5NF is mainly used in **highly relational, rule-based systems** — like:\n",

    "### 🔹 **8. What is the relationship between 5NF and lossless decomposition?**\n",

    "A **lossless decomposition** means you can reconstruct the original table from its decomposed parts **without losing or adding rows**.\n",
    "5NF ensures all decompositions are **lossless**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",

    "**Answer:**\n",
    "No.\n",
    "Like 3NF and 4NF, in 5NF all non-key attributes must depend only on keys — but now even **indirect join relationships** are considered.\n",
