    "### **Idempotent: Definition and Importance**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Idempotent** in the context of data engineering and software systems refers to operations or processes that produce the same result no matter how many times they are executed, given the same input conditions. In data pipelines, idempotency ensures consistent, reliable, and repeatable results, which is critical for robust and error-free data processing.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Characteristics of Idempotent Pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Same Results Regardless of the Day You Run It**  \n",
    "   - The pipeline must handle historical data or rerun scenarios without altering the results.\n",
    "   - For example, a data pipeline aggregating sales data for November should produce identical results whether run on December 1 or December 5, as long as the data source remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Same Results Regardless of How Many Times You Run It**  \n",
    "   - The operation should be repeatable without introducing duplicate or erroneous records.\n",
    "   - Example: If you are upserting a record into a database, an idempotent operation will not create duplicate rows even if executed multiple times. Using **MERGE** in SQL ensures this behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Same Results Regardless of the Hour You Run It**  \n",
    "   - Pipelines should account for time-zone differences, incremental data loads, and consistent cutoff times.\n",
    "   - Example: A pipeline processing transactions for a specific day should correctly handle late-arriving data and only process the intended time range.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Key Principles to Achieve Idempotency in Data Pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Use Primary Keys and Upserts**  \n",
    "   - Leverage **unique keys** in your database to prevent duplicates. Operations like `INSERT ... ON DUPLICATE KEY UPDATE` or SQL `MERGE` statements ensure that only new or changed data is written.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**  \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   MERGE INTO target_table t\n",
    "   USING source_table s\n",
    "   ON t.id = s.id\n",
    "   WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET t.value = s.value\n",
    "   WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (id, value) VALUES (s.id, s.value);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Time Partitioning and Watermarking**  \n",
    "   - Partition data by logical time intervals (e.g., daily or hourly).\n",
    "   - Maintain watermarks to track the maximum timestamp of processed data to ensure no duplication occurs during reprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**  \n",
    "   If your watermark for processed data is `2024-11-23 23:59:59`, re-running the pipeline on `2024-11-24` should only process data starting from `2024-11-24 00:00:00`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Avoid Side Effects**  \n",
    "   - Ensure operations do not have unintended consequences outside the scope of the pipeline (e.g., sending notifications, triggering downstream processes).\n",
    "   - Use **atomic transactions** to group changes so that all succeed or fail together.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Checksum or Hashing**  \n",
    "   - Generate hashes for each row to detect changes.\n",
    "   - Example: Compare a `MD5` hash of the incoming data with the stored data to decide whether to update.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example Code for Hash Check:**  \n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   import hashlib\n",
    "\n",
    "   def generate_hash(row):\n",
    "       return hashlib.md5(str(row).encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()\n",
    "\n",
    "   if generate_hash(new_data) != stored_hash:\n",
    "       update_record(new_data)\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Implementing Retry Logic**  \n",
    "   - Ensure pipelines gracefully handle retries without duplicating results.\n",
    "   - Use idempotent writes and proper state management.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**\n",
    "\n",
    "Idempotency is particularly important when working with **Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD)**. These dimensions require strategies to handle changes in dimensional attributes while maintaining historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **SCD Types and Idempotency**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **SCD Type 1 (Overwrite Changes)**  \n",
    "   - The current value overwrites the existing value.\n",
    "   - Idempotent by nature: Re-running the pipeline produces the same final state.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**  \n",
    "   Updating a customer’s address field in a database table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   UPDATE customer_dim\n",
    "   SET address = 'New Address'\n",
    "   WHERE customer_id = 101;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **SCD Type 2 (Maintain History)**  \n",
    "   - A new record is created for changes, preserving the old record.\n",
    "   - To ensure idempotency:\n",
    "     - Use surrogate keys.\n",
    "     - Check for existing records before inserting new ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**  \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   -- Insert a new record if there is a change\n",
    "   INSERT INTO customer_dim (customer_id, address, effective_date, expiry_date)\n",
    "   SELECT s.customer_id, s.address, CURRENT_DATE, NULL\n",
    "   FROM source_table s\n",
    "   LEFT JOIN customer_dim c\n",
    "   ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id\n",
    "   WHERE s.address != c.address OR c.expiry_date IS NOT NULL;\n",
    "\n",
    "   -- Mark the old record as expired\n",
    "   UPDATE customer_dim\n",
    "   SET expiry_date = CURRENT_DATE - 1\n",
    "   WHERE customer_id IN (SELECT customer_id FROM source_table);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **SCD Type 3 (Track Limited History)**  \n",
    "   - The old value is retained in a designated column.\n",
    "   - Ensure updates happen idempotently to avoid altering previous states.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Benefits of Idempotent Pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Error Recovery**: Safe to retry failed jobs without risking duplicates or incorrect results.\n",
    "2. **Ease of Maintenance**: Debugging and reruns are straightforward, as pipeline logic is consistent.\n",
    "3. **Auditability**: Historical and processed data integrity is preserved, aiding compliance and reporting.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Additional Considerations**\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Immutable Data Architecture**: Write-only models, such as those used in event sourcing, naturally support idempotency.\n",
    "- **Distributed Systems**: Ensure idempotency across distributed nodes by employing techniques like **exactly-once semantics** or **deduplication**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By adhering to these principles and examples, you'll ensure your pipelines are resilient, predictable, and interview-ready."

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why is Troubleshooting Non-Idempotent Pipelines Hard?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Silent Failures**\n",
    "   - Non-idempotent pipelines might complete without throwing errors but still introduce incorrect data into the system. These issues often go unnoticed during the initial runs.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Suppose you’re loading customer transactions but accidentally duplicate records due to a missing unique constraint. The pipeline appears successful, but downstream aggregates (like total revenue) will be incorrect.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Illustration: Silent Failure**\n",
    "   ```plaintext\n",
    "   Pipeline Run → Successful (No Errors) \n",
    "               ↓\n",
    "       Duplicate Records Enter Database\n",
    "               ↓\n",
    "  Data Analyst Notices Revenue Inconsistencies Weeks Later\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Manifestation as Data Inconsistencies**\n",
    "   - The problem only becomes evident when downstream users (e.g., data analysts) encounter inconsistencies. This often results in frustrated stakeholders.\n",
    "   - **Example:** An analyst working on churn prediction discovers discrepancies in historical customer subscription data caused by repeated or skipped updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Diagram: Non-Idempotent Pipeline Issue Manifestation**\n",

    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Can Make a Pipeline Non-Idempotent?**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Insert Without Truncate**\n",
    "   - Using plain `INSERT INTO` without truncating or managing duplicates leads to multiple copies of the same data.\n",
    "   - **Best Practice:** Use `MERGE` or `INSERT OVERWRITE` to avoid duplicates.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example: Fix with MERGE**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   MERGE INTO target_table t\n",
    "   USING source_table s\n",
    "   ON t.id = s.id\n",
    "   WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET t.value = s.value\n",
    "   WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (id, value) VALUES (s.id, s.value);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Using `Start Date` Without a Corresponding `End Date`**\n",
    "   - Querying data with an open-ended start date (`start_date > X`) without a clear endpoint can result in overlapping or missing data.\n",
    "   - **Best Practice:** Always define a bounded date range.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Bad Example:**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date > '2024-11-01';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Fixed Example:**\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date BETWEEN '2024-11-01' AND '2024-11-24';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Not Using a Full Set of Partition Sensors**\n",
    "   - Running pipelines without ensuring that all data partitions are available can lead to partial or incomplete processing.\n",
    "   - **Example:** A pipeline processing hourly logs might run even if one hour’s data is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Best Practice:** Use **partition sensors** in orchestration tools (e.g., Airflow) to ensure all required partitions exist before execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. **Not Using `depends_on_past` for Cumulative Pipelines**\n",
    "   - Cumulative pipelines often require sequential execution, as each run builds on the previous one. Skipping a dependency can lead to data gaps or overlaps.\n",
    "   - **Example in Airflow:**\n",
    "   ```python\n",
    "   task = PythonOperator(\n",
    "       task_id=\"cumulative_pipeline\",\n",
    "       python_callable=run_cumulative_job,\n",
    "       depends_on_past=True\n",
    "   )\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. **Relying on the \"Latest\" Partition of a Poorly Modeled SCD Table**\n",
    "   - If the \"latest\" partition logic isn't robust (e.g., missing updates or wrong primary keys), it can introduce inaccuracies in cumulative tables.\n",
    "   - **Example of Poor Design:**  \n",
    "     Fetching the latest value based on a timestamp column but ignoring overlaps or missing updates.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Best Practice:** Always explicitly track historical and current records using techniques like SCD Type 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 6. **Relying on the \"Latest\" Partition of Anything Else**\n",
    "   - This approach is prone to errors when partition logic doesn’t account for delayed or incomplete data.\n",
    "   - **Example:** Processing web logs based on the latest file might miss late-arriving data from an earlier period.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Solution:** Use watermarking or explicit time windows to handle late-arriving data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **The Pain of Non-Idempotent Pipelines**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Backfilling Causes Inconsistencies**\n",
    "   - When you try to reprocess historical data, inconsistencies can arise because the pipeline was not designed to overwrite or correctly merge old data.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:**\n",
    "   - A backfill job overwrites valid new records with outdated data, creating confusion in reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Very Hard to Troubleshoot Bugs**\n",
    "   - Debugging becomes challenging because non-idempotent pipelines lack predictable behavior. Issues may depend on the order or timing of runs.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Unit Testing Cannot Replicate Production Behavior**\n",
    "   - Unit tests simulate ideal conditions, but in production, factors like late-arriving data, missing partitions, and overlapping jobs can break the pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "   **Example:** A test suite passes in a dev environment but fails in production because of real-world issues like time-skewed data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Silent Failures**\n",
    "   - Errors may not immediately surface, making them harder to detect. By the time inconsistencies are identified, the corrupted data has already propagated downstream.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **How to Avoid the Pain?**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Design for Idempotency**\n",
    "   - Use **MERGE**, **deduplication strategies**, and robust partitioning.\n",
    "   - Ensure pipelines can handle retries gracefully without causing side effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Enforce Validation**\n",
    "   - Use automated checks for partition completeness, data integrity, and boundary conditions.\n",

    "   - Implement logging and monitoring to detect silent failures early.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Test for Edge Cases**\n",
    "   - Include scenarios like late-arriving data, missing partitions, and multiple retries in test cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Robust Orchestration**\n",
    "   - Use tools like **Airflow** to enforce dependencies (`depends_on_past`) and partition sensors to guarantee completeness before execution.\n",

    "\n",
    "A **Slowly Changing Dimension** (SCD) is a method used in data warehousing to manage changes in dimension tables over time. Dimension tables store descriptive attributes (e.g., customer name, address, product type) that don’t change as frequently as fact tables but may still require periodic updates.\n",

    "### **Key Characteristics of SCD:**\n",
    "1. **Track Changes Over Time:**  \n",
    "   SCDs preserve historical data while keeping the current state.\n",
    "   \n",
    "2. **Different Types of SCDs:**  \n",
    "   Depending on business requirements, changes can be handled using various approaches:\n",
    "   - **Type 1:** Overwrite the old data (no history maintained).\n",
    "   - **Type 2:** Maintain a full history by creating a new record for every change.\n",
    "   - **Type 3:** Keep limited history by adding additional columns for \"previous\" values.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why SCDs are Important?**\n",
    "- They ensure historical data integrity.\n",
    "- They enable analysis of data trends over time (e.g., tracking how customer preferences evolve).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Why \"The Slower the Changes, the Better\" in SCD?**\n",
    "- Frequent updates to SCDs can lead to:\n",
    "  1. Larger storage requirements (e.g., in Type 2, where every change creates a new row).\n",
    "  2. Increased complexity in data processing (e.g., handling duplicate updates, ensuring idempotency).\n",
    "  3. Performance issues when querying for large historical data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example:**  \n",
    "- A product's category changes once every few years (e.g., \"Electronics\" to \"Home Appliances\").  \n",
    "- This is ideal for SCD because changes are rare, minimizing data churn.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Are SCDs Idempotent?**\n",
    "No, **SCDs are not inherently idempotent** because:\n",
    "1. Each run of the pipeline might introduce new rows or update existing rows differently depending on the input.\n",
    "2. Without careful handling, duplicate or inconsistent data can appear in the dimension table.\n",

    "\n",
    "#### 1. **Preference Changes**\n",
    "   - **Example:** Someone decides they no longer like iPhones and switch to Android.\n",

    "#### 1. **Business Insights**\n",
    "   - Tracking preference changes can reveal valuable trends (e.g., rising popularity of Android devices or cats).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Personalized Marketing**\n",
    "   - Updates in preferences allow businesses to deliver targeted ads (e.g., promoting cat food instead of dog food).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. **Regulatory Compliance**\n",
